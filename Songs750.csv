Got a little southern drawl in my talk
Little pickup truck on my highway
Got a little boot stomp in my walk
Little neon lighting my Friday
Got some Tennessee in my whiskey
Raise a cup up if you with me

I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie

If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country

It's the only reason that I survived

I walk in on Friday nights
Same old bar, same burned out lights
Same people and all the same faces
So why in the hell does it feel like a different place?

Meet my friends for a girls' night out
Seems there ain't much to talk about
Same drinks that we're all raising
But all of the toasts just don't feel the same

We used to be the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act
Maybe they're like me and they want us back
It's like there's always an empty space
Those memories that nobody can erase
Of how bright we burned
Well now it hurts, but it's true
When they think of me, they think of you
They keep asking how I am
But they're really asking where you've been
I can read between all of the lines
It ain't just us missing all of the times

We were the life of the party
We used to be the ones that they wished they were
But now it's like they don't know how to act

Tuesday night, crowded bar
Some guy lights a cheap cigar
Bartender yells at him
So he walks out and you walk in
Right through that cloud of smoke
Catcalls and dirty jokes
Scan the room a couple times
Find a seat right next to mine

Lonely eyes, well it sure looks like
You just might be looking for something
For something, whoa oh oh oh
Look at me and I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes don't have to be alone tonight

They analyze your glass of wine
Roll away a pickup line
Now and then they check your phone
Catch mine and let 'em go
From the little bit I've seen
They're the perfect shade of green
Next time they come my way
Heaven help me, make 'em stay

You just might be looking for something

Look at me and I think you'll see
Those lonely eyes don't have to be alone tonight

Don't make me pay my tab, catch a cab
Go home and kick myself to sleep tonight
Gimme a sign, just a smile
Baby, I'll be glad to lose myself deep inside

Rum-runners and cold Bud Light

Packed in tight, they were singin' along

When you spilled your beer down the back of my shirt
You had me when I turned around

Smoke rings 'round the neon
Moonlight in your blue eyes
'Neath that Georgia hat that you had on

And more kisses than I could count
The best kind of wild and down-home smile

The ams were screamin' and the people were too
While were slow dancing on our bare feet
Ain't it funny how we missed it all
And still didn't miss a thing?

When she leaves, she's always gone too soon

We laughed and joked in the cab of his truck

The night before he shipped out overseas
A leatherneck, Jarhead Marine

He said ""the Radiator leaks
And the timing-belt is worn
But the Heart and Soul of this old beat up truck
Is The Dashboard.""

""It's seen a lot of tan legs
Got a kick ass radio
Heard a lot of singing along with some country songs
And rock and roll
Got a .38 bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad
A lot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs.""
He said ""If I don't come back
You can have this Ford
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard.""
He said ""The paint is peeling off
It's got dents in both the doors
If something happens to me
Don't hang a for-sale sign above the dashboard.""

In a shoebox the other night
In between cleaning up piles of messes
That I've made of my life

I dumped them all out on the bed
Found a homemade birthday card from my mom
And this is what it said
Yeah, this is what it said

When the way home seems so far away
Take 'em out and hold them close
And take a picture with your father
'Cause one day he'll be gone
And don't forget to fill an old shoebox
Full of things to look back on
Full of things to look back on
I opened up my grandpa's pocket knife
And I was back to his back porch
It was summertime, I was turning nine
He said you want that knife, it's yours
I remember running off in the yard
Carved my name in every tree
I haven't held it since he passed away
Man it meant the world to me
Because he meant the world to me

Hangin' out at the old park pool
Right after Sunday school
Banana Boat, a rubber float
Another summer afternoon
Bon fire at the creek tonight
Bubba bringin' some homemade wine
Just enough to catch a buzz
And get us countrified

Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time

A population 903
Half of them are kin to me
And those that ain't they know my name
We're like one big family
Gather at that old camp site
To lie about the fish and their size
Uncle Carl and his old guitar
Singin' Louisiana Saturday Night
Oh, my my, that's just the way we do it
Cut off Levi's and kickin' country music
Miles from nowhere, there ain't no city limits
And that's where you're gonna find us havin' a small town big time

Pyroman (Pyroman)

Du lundi au lundi, Gucci et Fendi, on a les llets-bi, han
J'ai gros appétit, où sont les fimbis ? Où sont les ladys ? Han
Admire la berline, bling-bling, toujours le calibre
L'enfant est terrible, l'enfant est, l'enfant est terrible
Du lundi au lundi, Gucci et Fendi, on a les llets-bi, han (hein, hein)
J'ai gros appétit, où sont les fimbis ? Où sont les ladys ? Han (hein, hein)
Admire la berline, bling-bling, toujours le calibre (hein, hein)
L'enfant est terrible, l'enfant est, l'enfant est terrible (hein, hein)

Ici, c'est terrible, on veut plus aller à l'intérim
On préfère augmenter les délits
Et au quartier, tout l'monde nous obéit, chef
Bandit, truand d'la galère, gang
Voir ma face devient ton malheur
Imbécile trop loin, ma gueule toujours dans l'avion
Tu cherches Koro, reviens t'à'l'heure
Putain, c'est mort (putain, c'est mort)
La dot est trop chère, j'vais la pacser
T'façon cousin, ou ja fout konnen
Ici, les zinzins volent chez les voisins
Ici, les zinzins braquent les magasins
Bazar, charo t'accoste même en bazin
La cité m'a dit de le faire, promis juré, j'vais tout raser
Du lundi au lundi, Gucci et Fendi, on a les llets-bi, han (hein, hein)
J'ai gros appétit, où sont les fimbis ? Où sont les ladys ? Han (hein, hein)
Admire la berline, bling-bling, toujours le calibre (hein, hein)

Pas besoin de dire qu'on est les boss
Chacal sait déjà qu'on contrôle la zone
J'ai dit Charo Empire, nouvelle époque
Vendre des disques, c'est bien mieux que la drogue
J'vais lui baffer son fessier, lui casser les reins
Lui plier les dorsaux, lui attacher les mains
Pendant qu'on zonait, qu'on volait arraché
Tu dansais le logobi à Châtelet - Les Halles
Que des bâtards, nous, c'est la violence
Faire des amis, ça n'a pas d'importance
Viens on parle en euros, boy, fais-moi confiance
Investit tes sous, ne suis pas la tendance
Petit à petit on mène la cadence
Tous les mogos vont imiter ma danse
Tous l'monde a dit que j'allais pas faire longtemps
Quatre ans plus tard, j'suis encore dans les temps (eh)

Depuis petit, j'fais le dièse, après l'charbon, j'fais la fête jusqu'à sept heures du matin
Autrefois tard dans la nuit, on rentrait par la fenêtre pour voler chez les voisins
Ils ont vu qu'c'est nous les boss, (ils ont vu qu'c'est nous les boss)
La défaite, on connait pas (la défaite, on connait pas)
C'est toujours nous les mauvais gosses (c'est toujours nous les mauvais gosses)
Vivre ou mourir banlieusard (gang, gang, gang, gang)
Souvent posé à la tess, c'est qui cette go' ? Faut qu'j'la baise, oui merci, j'suis un charo
C'est pas la peine de v'nir nous faire la morale
Toute manière, en général, tout l'monde fait un peu de mal (tout l'monde fait un peu de sale)
J'mets mes lacets, je suis délivré (j'suis délivré)
Ils m'ont menacé, j'ai pas balancé (pas balancé)
La quantité, on l'a ramenée (l'a ramené), on l'a détaillée, c'est eux qui livraient

Tu sais nous la nuit, on fait la fête
Ces temps-ci, c'est un peu la dèche, j'dois m'démerder tous les jours
Ramenez-moi à Brazzaville, j'me sens pisté par les traîtres, j'crois qu'mon phone est sur écoute
Depuis l'début, on est gang, on restera toujours gang
Zifukoro, il est gang, il restera toujours gang
J'crois que les cieux ne répondent plus et nos cœurs sont brisés, mais ça n'recolle plus
Même si j'te l'dis, t'peux pas comprendre, quand c'tait la galère, y avait pas grand monde
La vie est belle sous l'mauvais angle, c'que je vis, c'est pour de vrai
Ce que je chante, c'est pour les braves, c'que je dis, c'est pour de vrai
On a fait du sale, l'époque est passée vite, on craint le mal
Les tits-pe ont capté l'vice, ont repris l'bail
Et ceux qui ont joué les gros n'ont plus de talles (plus de talles)
C'est la merde, c'est normal

Mais tu n'm'en voudras pas, je suis un chacal, t'avais raison
Tu dis qu'j'n'ai pas de cœur, j'te dis qu'c'est juste une mauvaise gestion

Hey, sale, hey

Un rat des villes en bas des halls, le système m'a eu, j'passe ma vie sous filature
J'ai toujours eu le mauvais rôle, quoique j'dise ou fasse, ils chercheront que mes lacunes
Y a une taupe dans le réseau, vidéo prise du ciel par l'Mondeo
Mes khos m'ont dit : ""Korozif, faut faire des ronds""
Vends des disques s'il te plaît, lâche pas les crocs, gang
J'les ai vu paniquer, si j's'rais pas méchant j'sais qu'ils m'auront d'jà niqué
Exceptionnellement, ce soir, j'sors pas calibré, ici, y a des traîtres, beaucoup trop d'sales idées

Mais pourquoi j'leur fais ça ? Moi, je sais plus, gros
De toute façon, c'est que l'début
Comme devant l'Beretta, y a plus d'excuse, gros
J'fais trop de sale, parfois, j'me reconnais plus
Merde
Donne-moi des flingues, donne-moi des roses
Je sors de la tess, moi, j'veux jouer l'premier rôle
Les problèmes font jamais de pause, va aider ta mère, arrête de jouer les pauvres
À chaque jour suffit sa peine (peine, peine, peine, peine), à chaque nuit suffit sa chienne
À chaque jour suffit sa peine (peine, peine, peine, peine), à chaque nuit suffit sa chienne

Quand y a l'bénef on sourit bêtement, vive l'argent d'la SACEM et d'la drogue
Le gamos a quatre pots d'échappement, vive l'argent d'la SACEM et d'la drogue
Demain, je change de tain-p', j'en prends une autre à la place
J'me demande comment je fais pour m'regarder dans la glace
Dehors, c'est l'anarchie chacun fait ce qu'il doit faire, hein

Minuit et quart, Charlie D', tous les jours, bât' de la B'
Guerre de gang, everyday, je tire l'alarme : RER D
Pourquoi ces bouffons racontent de la D ? La rue, c'est nous, on a connu la vraie
Toute l'équipe a le corps balafré, la brigade des stup', c'est des bataradés
Le nerf de la guerre, c'est l'oseille et les fimbis, les gravons m'ont dit ""fais attention""

J'dois m'acheter le dernier nouveau Lamborghini donc toi tu veux gâter mes plans (plans)
Bousillé, tétanisé, elle a du sperme dans le gosier
Ça y est, on y est, dorénavant tout est quadrillé
Attila, Karachika, force de gorille dans le makila
C'est qui qui veut faire la mafia ? Qui veut finir dans le corbillard ?

Eh, viens pas me serrer la main pour me chanter tes salades

J'ai une villa cachée près de Jemaa el-Fna, mon fils et mon banquier me parlent arabe

C'est l'histoire d'un gang qui en quelques années, a perdu la moitié des membres
L'histoire d'un junky, en quelques billets, m'a donné une envie de vendre
Ici, c'est la basse-cour, c'est nous les coqs, les poulets, on leur fait l'amour
Champtier du Coq-Évry, j'ai fait le tour, le Maire de ma ville veut me casser ma tour
En quelques années, on a augmenté les fours, tu croyais vraiment qu'on finirait bredouille ?
Un fusil à pompe est dans ma fouille, devant l'OPJ, j'ai dû porter mes couilles
Affaire classée, j'remets mes lacets, dépôt, j'ressors, j'monte dans mon Classe C
Retour au tieks, les jambons sont passés, le guetteur a merdé, faut le remplacer
Négro, c'est d'la D : ma pute sait tout faire, ma femme sait rien faire mais comment on va faire ?
Et y a rien à perdre, charo, c'est nous, même sur une jambe, je leur ferai la guerre
Même sur une jambe, je leur ferai la guerre, pour avoir du caviar, j'ai dû manger des pierres
À treize ans, encore, j'avais pas vu la mer, j'passais mes vacances chez la sœur de ma mère
Les Baconnets, localisés, dans l'9.2, ils fuck toutes les banalisées
Mes congolais, mes soninkés, on vendait la dope pendant qu'tu révisais
On va t'gato zinzin, djangalémé, plaquage au sol, Jonah Lomu
Tu fais l'zoulou, tu veux m'allumer ? Tu vas finir sous aluminium
Niarry Tally, ma première au bled, salam au gang, Diallo Ousmane
J'ai pété les plombs sur la misère, là-bas, ils ont rien mais ils partagent le riz
À la madrassa, tu sais ce que j'ai vu ? Ils récitaient mal, ils ont fouetté le p'tit
Quand j'sortais de boîte, j'étais anéanti, j'ai vu des familles toute entière qui mendient
Mendicité, mendicité, beaucoup m'ont sucé pour d'la publicité
J'ai médité et en vérité, la plupart d'entre eux sont des futilités
En réalité, j'sais même pas qui t'es, le jour de mon hlal, tu s'ras pas invité
Le jour de mon hlal, tu s'ras pas invité

La jalousie, c'est pour les faibles
Allô ? Bonjour, Monsieur Diallo
On commence par où ? J'les termine ou pas ?

J'suis violent comme sud de l'Italie, mafieux comme les trap' à Tony (Tony)

Il lui a mis dans la tête, parce que son petit frère s'est fait salir
J't'ai pas fait du sale gros, j'ai failli mais devant les keufs, j'ai du tailler
Tu crois vraiment qu'on est gogole, parce que tu vois qu'on gesticule ?

Pyroman

T'as voulu la vie de Tony dans la rue mais l'addition est salée (L'addition est salée)
Ne joue pas les gros dans la street, tu te feras monter par un cadet
J'ai grandi dans l'illégal, au 'phone, il ne faut jamais parler
La chatte de la petite est sale, mon lit sent le poisson salé (Pue du cul)
J'ai baigné au Champtier du Coq, on trainait dehors jusqu'à pas d'heure (Traînait, traînait)
Depuis que je connais le Glock, mes ennemis ont perdu d'la valeur (Tout perdu)
Torse nu comme un mongole, on insultait les passants qui passaient (Fils de pute)
Le ciel gronde pendant dans la nuit, l'impression qu'le Seigneur est fâché (Brr, brr)

Mais comment ça, personne ne parle ? (Huh) Quand est-ce qu'on va manger notre part ? (Huh)
Certains d'entre eux veulent pas nous voir (Nan), on m'traite comme un putain d'esclave
Ma chérie, m'raconte pas tes salades, ce soir, j'vais te verser la mayo (Du me-sper)
J'ai dealé ma dope dans le coin, j'ai déployé mes ailes comme un charo
T'as voulu la vie de Tony dans la rue mais l'addition est salée (L'addition est salée)

Ils ont dit : ""Demain, c'est loin"" mais on n'y croit même pas
J'vous emmerde, j'suis au bord de la mer, j'allume mon Cohiba (Bye, bye, bye)
J'reviens des Pays-Bas, j'augmente le PIB
On fait les bails et j'baise les prohibés, le taf, ça paie pas (Jamain)
Igo, donne-moi la maille, donne-moi l'bail ou j'brise la vitre
Elle veut s'acheter des nouvelles fringues, elle bosse pour nous sur VivaStreet
À quoi bon sert de jouer les dingues ? On viendra te faire où tu habites
Un coup d'fil, une liasse dans l'enveloppe, j'ai de quoi d'faire enlever la vie

Excuse-moi, ma chérie dis-moi comment tu t'appelles ?

Ça dépend des jours, pour me faire des sous
Je fais la nounou quand parfois je sors des cours
Ouais j'avoue c'est un peu relou, ça me prend le chou
Et les gosses ils jouent les fous
Je lui demande qui est son petit copain
Elle me répond qu'elle n'y pense même pas
Elle me sourit et trouve que j'suis trop coquin
Et là sur le coup je viens de marquer le point
Et là j'ai pris la confiance, j'ai sorti mon phone,  j'l'ai pointé vers elle
S'il te plait, peux-tu me mettre ton Snapchat ?

Verse pas de larmes petit frère, de t'façons il faudra s'y faire
Pour m'acheter des nouvelles paires, j'ai charbonné pendant l'hiver (putain de merde)
Rappeur ou bien dealeur, j'ai toujours été dans le commerce
Je veux que tu twerkes dans le binks (bébé), quand tu n'as plus rien à faire
J'ai plus le temps pour la guerre (bébé), j'envoies mon fils pour la faire
Et montre-moi que t'es une reine (bébé), j'te laisserai peut-être mes affaires

Et ça pue le crime dans le hood, everyday je prends une arme (prends une arme)

J'suis dans les bails, je vois la baie
Y'a pas d'grève le jour de la paie
Le charo est sorti d'la pègre
J'ai pas ton temps, fous-moi la paix
T'investis dans la taule et nous dans la pierre
Y'a la couleur du sang sur mon drapeau
La force du gorille sous les trapèzes
La moitié du gang est au cachot
J'ai le rap facile comme la gâchette
C'est mon train d'vie et j'm'en bats la race
Ici bas j'ai compris qu'rien n'est gratuit
Ils nous aiment pas, j'me voile pas la face
Quoi qu'on dise ils nous prennent pour des bandits
Quoi qu'on dise ils nous prennent pour des chiens, pour des cons, pour des clowns, pour des baltringues ou des zoulous
Quoi qu'ils fassent, moi, je traîne pour les miens, bosse pour les miens
Vis pour les miens, crève pour les miens
J'pars au charbon comme un talibé
Chérie fais l'amour, fais la bouffe, je fais des sous
Les produits d'ici sont de qualité
Si tu veux la dope, par ici fais un tour

Pour un rien faut pas mythonner, c'est des putes, faut pas les coller
Comme Audi, faut pas déconner
Tu connais, faudra les cogner
C'est un schlag, j'vais pas lui donner
J'te souris, j'vais pas rigoler
Rien ne sert de faire l'étonné, ton équipe se fait détrôner
Et t'sais on devient pas un homme en battant une femme
On devient pas un bonhomme en arrachant une dame
On fume le kilo d'Al Fakher
On vend la weed hollandaise (my nigga)
Ça tire comme à Malakoff (hein)
L'histoire de gun, parenthèse
Toi, t'es personne, on t'a pas présenté
Ati, L'Essone Angeles, j'suis v'nu représenter
A la calle on va pas plaisanter
Tu n'es pas dans nos dièses, on va pas s'fréquenter
J'ai plus bécane, fusil que le piano dans nos favelas
J'trouve plus de confort dans liasses d'oseille que dans le lit d'Pamela
Si loin de Louis XVI, si proche de Louis Vui', de Dolce Gabanna

Prends-moi comme je suis, tu s'ras pas déçue

Violent comme à l’ancienne, triste comme purger une peine
Tous ces négros m’donnent la haine, à toujours vouloir qu’on les craigne
Oh, j’t’en prie mon Dieu, pardonnez-les s’ils me jugent
Ces jeunes hommes sont pas comme nous, ils n’ont pas connu le luxe
Pourquoi vendre des meujs, pour même pas faire 2 000 euros ?
Ze3ma t’es pas un dep', bah bravo monsieur l’hétéro
Ah, Madame la Proc’, un jacuzzi en Enfer
Igo on va te faire, d'Evry-Courcouronnes au Bras de Fer
À qui ils vendront les armes, si nous arrêtons d’faire la guerre ?
Négro trop dupe, négro trop con, négro trop fier
Bang bang raboule la caisse, j’t’agresse par manque de graisse
Oh, je dois m’engraisser, dorénavant j’dois encaisser
Zifukoro
Zifukoro

Escroc comme un Madoff, ou escroc comme un mécano
Ils vont sucer mon sang, ils vont sucer mon sang, j’vais finir drépano'
Ah, Monsieur l’agent, pourquoi nous brutaliser ?
De garde-à-vue en garde-à-vue on est fidélisés
Combien de ces vendus ont voulu qu'on les rachète ?
Avoir le sida c’est comme marcher avec des traîtres
Ah, ta sœur la pute, viens pas nous casser les couilles
Étant voyou j’laissais des punchlines dans ma fouille
Moi j’dois pardonner tous ces petits envieux
Ah, j’t’ai pas donné, toi aussi tu m’en veux
Le rap accidenté, depuis qu’j’ai cartonné
Secteur représenté, d’Evry aux Baconnets

Zifukoro
Zifukoro

L’échec, on connaît pas, on connaît qu’le liquide
C’est qui qu’a fait couler le sang sur nos terres d’origine ?
Ce succès de merde j’en ai rêvé, j’ai mouillé l’maillot, j’suis arrivé
Dorénavant aucun rival, tous ces rappeurs sont mes produits dérivés
Le père de mon père était jnouné, un vieux du village l’a évangélisé
Mon arrière grand-mère s’est fait tourner, à travers mon teint t’aperçois qu’je suis colonisé
Terroriser, j’vais les terroriser, sans faire de choix, j’vais pas favoriser
Tu vois ce jour faudra l’mémoriser, j’vais vous donner une leçon qu’faudra réviser
J’te laisse par terre, OG Kush dans la bouche, j’viens du hood
Négro t’as un flingue, j’en ai douze, j’ai le blues
Eh, prends rendez-vous chez l’ostéopathe
J’vais reprendre c’que me doit César, après minuit à l’hôtel j’me fais Cléopâtre

Tu sais ce que les ti-peu m'ont dit ? : Depuis que je perce, y a plus de consommateurs
Le marron devient même du yellow, je suis magicien, je suis un transformateur
Le charo ne parle pas beaucoup et té-ma le boug, le sujet est maitrisé
Dîner sur les Champs-Elysées avec mon président, je n'peux pas refuser
J'suis dans la fusée des fusées, je controle la ne-zo, comme la NASA (tiens)
Les pauvres, ils sont trop dégoûtés, même dans leurs showcases, je pète les caissons (oui)
Trapper, pour moi, c'est trop facile, comme un colombien qui cuisine la résine (pah)
Si demain, je sens la perquis', y a pas de soucis, je dors chez la voisine
Allô ? T'es où ? Oh, seigneur, t'es là, bango ba zo lela, nazo ko sepela
J'ai trop le truc à la 2Pac et Biggie, ce genre de beat me fait bouger
J'écris mes textes dans un buggy, j'vais t'sortir mon flingue, tu vas buguer (pff, pff, pff)
Les personnes continuent les manifestations, l'Etat continue : manipulation
Mademoiselle la proc', j'vous demande pardon, c'est pas de la beuh mais d'la végétation
Nouvelle location, je passe à la station (Total, Total, Total, Total)
C'est pas de la beuh mais d'la végétation (oui)
Je ne vends pas de rêves, je suis real (jamain)
Je ne vends pas de rêves, je suis real (ouais)
Demande-toi bien ""j'ai dû faire quoi ?""
Combien d'fois j'ai fait du sale ?
Mes fringues viennent d'Italia
Plein d'bijoux, grosse voiture
Plein d'bijoux, plein d'bijoux, grosse voiture
Belles montures, belles montures que veux-tu, girl ?
Tous mes charos ont d'l'orgueil

J'suis sur les Antilles, mes gavas sont locksés, tête énervée comme Dark Vador
Sabre laser comme Anakin, counia manmanw, je vous encule (paw, paw, paw)
Jungle, jungle, jungle, les petits ne veulent plus qu'on les vire, qu'on les engueule
Ils nous respectent car ils savent qu'on a fait du leum (Ils nous respectent car ils savent qu'on a fait du leum)
Baco Baco-Djicoroni, poto, poto, Niarry Tally, gang
J'enfile des gants pour t'enlever la vie et quand je le fais, j'le fais par hygiène
Je coupe et j'emballe et tu inhales, dans l'couloir d'la mort, il n'y a qu'une allée
Je bouge mes épaules comme au funaná et même en été, je vis sous la neige

Combien de ces pd j'ai fait ramper ? Ils n'ont même pas de quoi se la raconter

Concert en Guadeloupe, j'me jette dans la foule

Combien de frères perdus parlent avec des jnouns ?
Même dans le fond du Bronx, je marche avec des sous

Je n'peux pas baisser mon froc, je vais faire tomber mon Glock
Je n'peux pas baisser mon froc, je vais faire tomber mon Glock

J'suis discret comme appel anonyme, violent comme papa alcoolique
Ce genre de morceau va les terroriser, Charlie Hebdo fera la chronique
Le dentiste a capté les bails, ce fils de poucave a un palais d'justice
C'est bien si le brolique est vrai mais à quoi bon faire si les couilles sont factices
J'suis dans l'dur, c'est sûr, depuis l'époque du mur, on vend la pure
Accro à la violence, oh my God ! J'dois faire une cure
Gros j'ai charbonné, personne m'a rien donné, je n'sais pas chanter, je sais que fredonner
Toi qui t'as parlé ? Mais qui t'as klaxonné ? Sapés comme jamain, toi personne te connait

Sombre et rate-pi, fier comme un charo

J'te vois pas dans nos célébrations ni aux enterrements
Tu galères pour nous compter, négro on est tellement

Y'a des charos, des généraux, pirates depuis longtemps

Banlieusards forts et fiers
Bénis soient les miens
Rebelles depuis le sein

Un coup d'fil anonyme dans ta tess
Donne deux trois indic', j'ai ton adresse
J'prends le plus p'tit vaillant qui sort du habs
Il t'liquide ta mère, j'paye ses vacances
Allô, j'décroche mon bigo (allô)
La sœur d'un rappeur veut de la tendresse
Oh, complètement barjo
J'ai baisé sa mère par maladresse

J'veux l'feat avec Selena Gomez

J'suis congolais comme Georges N'goma

Et non, ma chérie, j'ai pas vendu mon âme, je côtoie le crime, je ne vends que du shit

J’suis dans l’hood, OG Kush, je fume ma dope
On est devenus des loups, on regrette nos vies d’ados
Ma chérie fait du squat, j’fais des pompes, j’fais des abdos
Brolique dans le sac à dos, en cas d’embrouille on t’cala bo

À longueur de journée, on braque que des foufounes, se bagarres en hiver fait craquer nos doudounes
J’suis dans la voiture des keufs, je passe à la tess, mes potes, j’leur fais des coucous
J’suis dans le Jura quand j’suis à Paris, y a trop d’CC sur Champs-Élysées
La barrette est tellement grosse, ne gueule pas trop fort, tu vas t’sodomiser
J’écris mes textes avec hargne, chez nous, la nourrice garde la coke et les armes (la coke et les armes)
Les hommes mentent contrairement aux chiffres, ramène le matos pour pas fausser les grammes
J’passe le salam à mon gang, aux tits-pe du tieks posés d'vant la boulange
À Issa, Tidjani, à Kiki, à Chekib, les gars bisous, j’vous fais des louanges
J’suis dans l’hood, OG Kush, je fume ma dope
On est devenus des loups, on regrette nos vies d’ados
Ma chérie fait du squat, j’fais des pompes, j’fais des abdos
Brolique dans le sac à dos, en cas d’embrouille on t’cala bo

Cala bo, cala bo, cala bo, cala boca
Cala bo, cala bo, cala bo, cala boca

Elles veulent ma bite, ils veulent mon biff, ma pute, ma gov’
Brolique sur les abdos, elle me suce quand j’roule un cône
J'suis pété, toute la journée avec mes bougz’ à fume la droga
Bibi te-shi, coke pour dégainer un bolide d’occaz’
J’suis dans l’hood, rien à foutre, everyday sur l'rrain-te, j’te parle pas de foot
Rien qu'ça fume la drogue douce, pédé, tire pas sur mon joint si tu tousses
Bébé vas t’refaire les fesses pas le temps pour faire du squat
Elle a tellement mouillé quand j’l’ai doigté qu’j’en ai les mains moites
Zifukoro des koro, mboka il faut to matissa likolo
Donc avec mes négros dans l’cke-blo, ça bibi, ça détaille des kilos
J’ai mon joujou caché dans la vago
Delta Charlie Delta, Congo, Schweitzer, 

J’suis dans l’hood, OG Kush, je fume ma dope
On est devenus des loups, on regrette nos vies d’ados
Ma chérie fait du squat, j’fais des pompes, j’fais des abdos
Brolique dans le sac à dos, en cas d’embrouille on t’cala bo
Cala bo, cala bo, cala bo, cala boca
Cala bo, cala bo, cala bo, cala boca

Elle claque des fesses comme on claque des milliers d’euros
Y’a pas qu’en arrachant des chaînes qu’on revend du doré
Un corps, de l’essence, une corde, un briquet, une forêt
Nouveau flow, nouvelles prod, nouveau style, nouvelle catégorie
J’vais leur briser l’orifice, j’veux ma part du bénéfice
Ils vont demander l’armistice, j’crois qu’j’ai capté le vice
Vente de cocaïne, vente de cannabis, vente de OG Kush
Fond du carré VIP, j’suis avec l’équipe, gros magnum Grey Goose

J’suis dans l’hood, OG Kush, je fume ma dope
On est devenus des loups, on regrette nos vies d’ados
Ma chérie fait du squat, j’fais des pompes, j’fais des abdos

Moi j'ai vendu avant d'être un consommateur
J'écrivais toujours des rimes, j'ai ce côté revendicateur
Souvent en manque de fraîche, l'argent me sert de ventilateur
Coup de couteau dans l'orifice, devant la mort t'as senti la peur

J'ai porté mes couilles, affronté la vie
J'suis devenu ce que je suis, aujourd'hui je suis riche et mon père est ravi
C'est vrai que j'ai changé de vie, mon avocat est juif et vient de Tel-Aviv
Mon avocat est tellement fort que je dors tranquille si je t'enlève la vie
J'suis à Charles de Gaulle, c'est bon je m'en vais
J'suis en classe affaire, je vais m'allonger
Mes frères vendent le pain comme des boulangers
Faut que je sorte du trou je veux m'en aller

Tu tires apparemment ?
Tu fais ça qu'oralement
Pourquoi tu cries mon grand ?

Pour tous les frères qui tombent
Jamais seul
Demande pas pourquoi derrière moi c'est sombre
C'est pas qu'je bombe

T'en as trois dans les mains, j'en ai dix

Pas l'temps pour les négros qui m'rapportent zéro
Tout le monde dos à dos, à la queuleuleu
Pour la beuh c'est par là
Pour la coke prends mon num
On s'voit en deux-deux
J'te passe quelques meuj' d'la re-pu
D'la re-pu, ma monnaie d'échange
Arrogant j'suis sur mon catamaran
Je remplis mon argent dans l'plus grand des silences

J'fais ma mula quitte à dépenser
Attaque à la machette comme un rebelle hutu

Ils ont pété le matos des matos
Sont partis du bando, dans le gamos des gamos
Trafic de stups dans les locaux du tieks
Prends ta galette comme au tacos

Dorénavant je vise l'bingo
Bana mboka ba zo buka mukongo
Bana poto ba zo beta Nintendo

Ramène les lingots de roro, numéro uno des uno

Ça réveille mes démons, ohlolo

B-B-B-Back to the Future
La jalousie c'est pour les faibles, crois-moi, j'te l'assure
Korozifu, hé, les médias vont m'censurer

Si aujourd'hui j'prends le large
Je dois éviter les barrages
C'est vrai qu'mon fils il prend de l'âge
Les jours ils passent et j'vois les lâches

Les jaloux me jugent, veulent savoir c'que j'fais dans la tess
J'ai compris, j'ai plus le temps pour les paires de fesses, l'Afrique est en pleurs, y'a mon bled qui m'appelle
Brazzaville, toi tu penses que ici ça bibi juste pour s'vanter
On n'est pas gangsters, nous charognards, qui peut te planter, qui peut te plomber ?
Ça vit tous les jours, bibi tous les jours
Les mecs d'à côté font les fous, sont-ils jaloux qu'il y ait un four ?
Mais où sont les vierges ? Que des sagittaires
NS : Negro Deep, comme Martin Luther
Si aujourd'hui j'prends le large
Je dois éviter les barrages
C'est vrai qu'mon fils il prend de l'âge
Les jours ils passent et j'vois les lâches

Commencez à prier au cas où ça va tirer
Pour mes charos écroués Avenue des peupliers
Quand j'dors la nuit, j'combats les démons de mes ennemis
Il est minuit et demi et j'ai mal à la vie

Second couplet je découpe, tu veux l'bénef tu la coupes
Igo, tu payes si tu touches, ma bouche est ma meilleure cartouche
Des kilos de pilon, des kilos de zetla, Rimka aurait dû jeter par la fenêtre
Si tu veux percer le monsieur m'a dit : ""Korozifu, ne fais pas la quenelle""
J'encule le peuple, le monde entier, mon meilleur ami c'est mon banquier
Moteur allemand sous l'avant-pied, j'vais investir dans la rre-pie
J'fume ma OG kush
J'compte mes liasses pendant ça Griselda dans la douche
Mama n'a pas le bac de lecture, pourtant elle sait lire les factures
J'remercie le ciel encore, il reste des bons hommes comme Gradur
Mais où sont les vrais ? Que des quiproquos
Si je pète le million, a ko ti na mboko

Si mon business marche plus, ma vie, j’irai braquer tous les jours
J’entends des fils de pute qui veulent salir mon parcours
Skaodi, je n’t’oublie pas, je pense à toi tous les jours
Y’a que du pain dans les fours, on crève la dalle comme au Darfour

Un keuf c’est un keuf, un neuf c’est un neuf, une meuf c’est une meuf
Vas-y ne paye pas ta dette et ta meuf sera une veuve
RER D, on tire l’alarme, Evry - Courcouronnes
Les diamants du Congo, du Zaïre seront bientôt sur ma couronne
Et j’les vois danser comme moi, j’les vois chanter comme moi
J’suis tellement loin, mon prochain texte, j’l’écris sur des fesses
Ketama est dans la massa, on contrôle la zone comme la NASA
Quand elle arrive elle est anale, quand tu la sniffes elle est nasale
Vrai charognard, j’suis dans les airs, mes coqs dans la basse cour
Je ne verse plus mes larmes, j’ai perdu des proches, des vrais dans mon parcours

Des proches ont perdu la santé, des proches ont perdu la te-tê

Sarkozy ramène la CC et c’est Hollande qui tape dedans

J'suis dans un plavan, y'a P-Skar et Trafiquinté
On revient au quartier, normal, on est bouche-bées
Brigi c'est l'brigand, Madrane se bagarre comme Cro Cop
Trafiquinté fait Bishop et Niska s'occupe de sortir le Glock

J'ai l'arme sur le terrain, j'arme le machin, fais pas la catin, puissant comme Pékin

J'suis dans le game des games, j'me fais des sous

Feels familiar
When the knife gets buried into my beating heart

Bloody, bruised, and cursing my own naiveté
I was on an empty beach
On a screaming all-time low

Yeah I know

I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim

Please release me
Helping hands aren't supposed to cut off my oxygen
And why won't you hear me
When I'm screaming at the top of my voice?

There's just one parachute

I was lost, but now I am found
A line was crossed, a vessel run aground
The boy has gone, let's grieve and let him go
He left a dog, but it's a new day don't you know

In the company of wolves I sat in silence
Observant and afraid
He was there with the eyes like glowing embers
The man you see was made

I was low but now I am high
It helps to know serenity from ennui anyway
Ooooh
Something's wrong, something's wrong, when it all remains the same
So face the fire, come into your name

In the company of wolves I sat in silence
Observant and afraid
He was there with the eyes like glowing embers
The man you see was made, oooooh
Even I can't recall how many days I had been out there
For when Aurora's lights ceased to shine
I was alive, I think, for the first time
And vanity it falls, in feathery folds but she bites like loveless eyes
But with her belly full she called this rite of passage, it was the longest night of my life

In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees

Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3D

I'll just move my hands and everyone sees what I mean
Words are too messy
And it's way past time
To hand in my mouth
Paint my face white and try to
Reinvent the sea
One wave at a time
Speak without my voice and see the world by candlelight

I'm not afraid to let it out
I'm unafraid to take that fall
But I have found beyond all doubt
We say more by saying nothing at all

In my fantasy no such thing as time
Minutes bleed into days

Show me your heresy
And I'll show you mine
We only speak in pantomimes on this carpet ride

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The after-world
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything Will Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
Because in this life
Things are much harder than in the after-world
In this life
You're on your own
And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy, punch a higher floor (Hey!)

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Uh, uh) is all I heard

Are we going to let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no, Let's Go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's because
We're all going to die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for (What's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door
Are we going to let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no, Let's Go!

Let's go crazy

Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

Pardon me while I burst

A decade ago, I never thought I would be
At twenty-three on the verge of spontaneous combustion

An ominous landscape of never ending calamity
I need you to hear, I need you to see
That I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility
To me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same
Not two days ago, I was having a look
In a book and I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees
I said, ""I can relate,"" because lately I've been
Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from
The burdens of the planet earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D
But thinking so much differently

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me... I'll never be the same
Never be the same, yeah

Earth to Bella
You think you've got it all figured in
Earth to Bella
Everything you know is wrong. Well, almost
Earth to Bella
I've seen when you are not listening
I bear the burden
Of being the voice that lets you know
We all grow old

And before you swim you've got to be okay to sink

Earth to Bella
The world can be an unfriendly place
So hold your head up (Hold your head up)
And do your best to save some face
It's not so hard
Just undo yourself and see a
Second sun ascend
Okay to sink
I'm okay to sink
Okay to sink
Okay to sinkEmbed",,"Earth To Bella, Pt. 1",

If it’s good to complicate then both of us are doing fine
Just keep your eyes on your part and leave me alone to mine

I think we just fight too much

Come on, in spite of this we’re doing just fine

Give us time to shine
Even diamonds start as coal

We’re both aligned in frame of mind, but circumstance has got us good
And now you’re seeing a side of me I wished no one ever would
Yeah, if it’s right to pick a fight, we’re fingers in a sugar bowl
Love isn't perfect

Even diamonds start as coal
We're incomplete and infantile

They burn before they shine
We think way too much
Look at us losing touch

Just in case I need a door

All solutions end up with my head
Buried to my neck in sand

Enough, enough bowing down to disillusion
Hats off & applause to rogues and evolution

If you’re not affected, you’re not paying attention
It’s too good, too good
Not to have an effect

I’m keeping an eye on the pulse
An ear to the track and penance in a locket
I’m dropping from the highest floor
When it hits ground I watch it smash to pieces
Songs of liberation echo from the dust, the dust
Enough, enough bowing down to disillusion

There’s an amassing armor and it’s building you into a bore

Don’t ever mourn the ebbing tide

Two people touching lips, hands on each other's hips
Nothing else in the world but one another
The 42nd floor on a distant shore
I wonder how we strayed so far from this
Remember when we were just flesh and bone, you sir
May have forgotten how good your world could be
So, put down your hollow tips and kiss your lover's lips
And know that fate is what you make of it

Please end this, please end this
Before this ends us, ends us
Ends

I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay inside for good
I wanna stay inside
For good, for good, for good, for good
For good, for good, for good, for good
I read the news today and everything they say
Just makes me want to stay inside and wait
But a part of me knows that waiting in the throes
Is on a par with reading with my eyes closed
""What can I do?"" You say, it's just another day
In the life of apes with ego trips
Put down your hollow tips and kiss your lover's lips
And know that fate is what you make of it

Please end this, please end this
Before this ends us, ends us
Ends us

That it's still worth it's weight in gold

When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
Seeing you is like pulling teeth
And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil, oh yeah

Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3D

At first I see an open wound
Infected and disastrous
It breathes chaotic catastrophe
It cries to be renewed (Please renew me!)
Its tears are the color of anger
They dry to form a scab
To the touch, its stiff and resilient
Underneath, the new skin breathes, yeah


It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?

As outwardly cliche as it may seem
Yes, something under the surface says ""c'est la vie""
There is a circle, it is a plan
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Look closely at the open wound
See past what covers the surface
Underneath chaotic catastrophe
Creation takes the stage, so
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again

It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?
It's all been seen
With the exception for what could be
But when will we be new skin?

Until the twentieth century, reality was everything humans could touch, smell, see, and hear. Since the initial publication of the chart of electromagnetic spectrum, humans have learned that what they can touch, smell, see, and hear is less than one millionth of reality.

Fallacious cognitions
Spewed from televisions
Do mold our decisions
So stop and take a look and you'll see what I see now
Now!

It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?
It's all been seen
With the exception for what could be
But when will we be new skin?

You can't make me think like you, mundane
I've got a message for all those who think that
They can etch his words inside my brain

What's the use of autonomy when a button does it all?
When a little button does it all, does it all?

So, listen up, listen up closely, all

It's time to step away from cable train
And when we finally see the subtle light
This quirk in evolution will begin
To let us live and recreate
Create again

Let me see past the fatuous knocks
I've got to rid myself of this idiot box
Let you see past the feathers and flocks
And help me plant a bomb in this idiot box

From the depths of the sea, to the tops of the trees
To the seat of a La-Z-Boy staring at a silver screen

On my way home
Police car pulled me over

After they left, I puttered out of gas
AAA came, but my card was expired
I had to walk home, and of course, it rained half the time
I tried to get some shut-eye, then I was abducted
They put cold things in my butt
They sampled a bit of my DNA
They left me on top of my sheets
I dreamt I went potty, then woke up drenched in me

This day sucked the hardest ever

I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today
A little bit less than nothing would go my way
I got up to toss my soiled sheets
The hallway was dark and I stubbed my big toe
It was then that I sensed the irony burning me
Then I heard the voice say
""Come sail aboard the S.S. Nepenthe""

I suppose I'm to blame

I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today
A little bit less than nothing would go my way

Thank goodness
For bathtubs and suds

I suppose I'm to blame for getting pulled over
I guess I'm the culprit for running out of gas
Let's assume I'm the guy who didn't pay his AAA fee
In actuality, I let the zetas probe me
Yesterday was all my fault
I let negativity get the better of me
Thank goodness for the bathtubs and suds
They temporarily set free this quandary
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today
A little bit less than nothing would go my way
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today
A little bit less than nothing would go my way

What if my watch read 4:20 every hour, every day?
You can bet your dollar I'd be happy

I forgot to remember
I forgot to remember my pain

Take me to your leader
Or die by the fly guy!
What if mothballs
Hanging around too close to microwaves
Suddenly woke up and said
""Take me to your leader
Or die by fly guy!
He'll push you out
No wings attached!""
Just do as I say, no mistake
He'll blow away
What if I was daydreaming?
What if I lived in a pear?
What if I had a mustard drenched cucumber
Tied to my leg and I
Did not want my pants to get dirty?
What if this, what if that?!

I forgot to remember
I forgot to remember my pain
I forgot to remember
I forgot to remember my pain

Forgot to inject my, cocaine!
Forgot to apply my, rogaine!
Forgot to remember, my pain!
I never think, I never thought
Oh, maybe I'm insane
I think I like being
Way the fuck out of my brain

I forgot to remember

Floating round my brain
Trying to think about the other thing

What if what I thought
About who I think I thought I was
Was nothing more than my cerebellum slobbering

But simple to trust
You'll know your on it when your brain
Won't stop to take a break, no
So when donut boy comes asking around
Trying to figure out something new
You just smile and say
""Pardon you! I'm sifting through some particles
And facing through some folds
I've stumbled upon a brain fart
Which melts away your molds!""
So I think upon that ponder while
I'm pondering the thought

Is leaving me distraught

Looking like we think we do

Looking like we think we do

Some think I'm insane
'Cause I think about the other thing
Than that one thought you call reality
What if what you thought
About who you think you thought you were
Was nothing more than illusion rapidly crumbling!

Azwethinkweism should be a topic we all can trust
It's just too bad that it makes your
Head go zippity crack dang!
So when donut boy comes sniffing around
Trying to figure out something new
You just laugh and say
Pardon you! I'm sifting through some particles and
Farcing through some folds

About a hundred years ago now
Thought I was left for dead
Soliloquy, she was my
A picture, a wake
My metaphoric friend
So then I fell in love with an irony named life
It taught me this from that and
A picture, a wake, you're going to be Hilikus

History has a tendency
To block out the popular beliefs
About the leaders of the time
So glisten with my syllables and
Ponder the thought
Maybe they should have
Had to dedicate more to it, go!

You've got to be
So good to be
You've got to be Hilikus!
So I took a walk out side
With my new found friend and the knowledge imbibe
I figured I'd find another
With the same attitude
Yes, then maybe I could talk
To someone other than myself!
The doors are swinging wide open
A positive attitude and the ilk in my pocket
Had a lot to do with my new found friend
The Hilikus

To block out the popular beliefs

To go another day as we learn to close

You turn around now and you count to ten
To see you go now

We started in the same neighborhood
Teenage hope, misunderstood
Stars fell around us in a wasted place
We took your parents' car out of town
Lost our minds 'til the sun went down
So we tried to grow up good in one day

We were young, kind of foolish
Deep down love kind of friendship
Lost beneath in an endless wave
We gave up on the good life
Threw our souls to the high tide
Never thought it would end this way

We ain't best friends no more
'Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
Two years, no love, no call
Now I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
I guess I'm riding solo
I guess I gotta let go
We ain't best friends no more
'Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
('Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh)

We used to keep our worlds tangled tight
Both our futures on one line
Just two tigers in a forest fire
But then we lost our stripes, we didn't care
Said you'd call, I was never there
Can we go back to the wilded life?

We were young, kind of foolish
Deep down love kind of friendship
Lost beneath in an endless wave
We gave up on the good life

Forgive and forget?

Want this to end
Should I want you?

But I can't get you out of my mind

No, I can't get you out of my mind

I'll tell you something you need to know
Nothing I can say phone to phone
I'll tell you something, but you have to sit close
You're the one that I miss the most

I've heard that you're happy
And maybe it's selfish of me
To want you back this time
I know we decided
It's better if we both were free
But it kills me now

We said our last goodbye
Won't you stay the night

Perfect lie, pretend we're fine

Though we're over, we're so not over
Pull me close, I need closure

This ain't the way that I thought we would live

When I start to feel I'm in trouble again
I just keep it as friends 'cause I know how it ends
When I feel like I'll be the devil again
I'll sit back and pretend like we both never met

I found courage at 16, but lost it at 23
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
And I lost my self-esteem believing in a dream
I lost my faith, I lost my faith, oh-oh

Ever since I heard the howlin' wind
I didn't need to go where a Bible went
But then you know your gifts seem heaven-sent, mm
Just lead me to a choler, dad, that's the thing

I don't know how you house the sin

And I'm free now

Won't you settle down, baby
Here your love has been

It's definitely lava
Why don't you carry other names?
Heard about a day where it dropped the know
To go another day as we learn to close

We started in the same neighborhood
Teenage hope, misunderstood
Stars fell around us in a wasted place
We took your parents' car out of town
Lost our minds 'til the sun went down
So we tried to grow up good in one day

We were young, kind of foolish
Deep down love kind of friendship
Lost beneath in an endless wave
We gave up on the good life
Threw our souls to the high tide
Never thought it would end this way

We ain't best friends no more
'Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
Two years, no love, no call
Now I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
I guess I'm riding solo
I guess I gotta let go
We ain't best friends no more
'Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh
('Cause I'm nothing like you-ooh-ooh)

We used to keep our worlds tangled tight
Both our futures on one line
Just two tigers in a forest fire
But then we lost our stripes, we didn't care
Said you'd call, I was never there
Can we go back to the wilded life?

We were young, kind of foolish
Deep down love kind of friendship
Lost beneath in an endless wave
We gave up on the good life
Threw our souls to the high tide
Never thought it would end this way

Lit my path so now I'm not
Stepping in puddles and falling in mud
Finally alonе, these nights are thе best
Lay on my chest and let out the stress
Two birds in a nest, I'll pick up the sticks
I wanna grow old with you and then look back on this
Hear the stream behind where we sit
Had to leave it all to begin
I don't wanna mess this up
Too often things are temporary
Alone watching fireworks bursting
It's cold, but my eyes still burning
Try not to beat myself up
I can take it if I'm waiting for your love

It gets cold on the Fourth of July
And I'll watch fireworks inside of your eyes
If you didn't have to leave I wouldn't mind
Never fight and
I don't wanna know what it's like (I don't wanna know what it's like)
It gets cold on the Fourth of July (Cold on the Fourth of July)
And I'll watch fireworks inside of your eyes (Fireworks inside of your eyes)
If you didn't have to leave I wouldn't mind (I wouldn't mind)
Never fight and
I don't wanna know what it's like, ayy

The journey has just begun, beauty and tragedy
Whatever happens, fall back on me (Fall back on me)
Hold me like gravity, watching the apple tree
Knew that the fruit would fall watching it happening
Hear the stream behind where we sit
Had to leave it all to begin
I don't wanna mess this up

Feel the wind blow, I can hear it in my left ear
Sounds like when you whispered to me but you're not around here
Life is slow, sleepin’ twelve hours a day, ayy
Since I had my surgery, it's never been the same
I'm sick and it sucks and my friends barely visit
Every week that goes by, end up feelin’ more distant
Cried so many times, tryna chip away my fear
Prayin' when I'm sad, thinkin' of our younger years
First night that you kissed me, cuddle watchin' Disney
Now I wait at night for a text that you miss me
Every second is a blessing when you're standing at my side
We didn't see this coming, it's okay to say goodbye

It’s okay to say goodbye
But I hate saying goodbyes
Would you stay here longer?
Sorry I’m not stronger
Speak to me with honesty, it's harder than we thought it’d be
Tell it to me straight, ayy, I don't want no ""probably""s
Tell me when you're tired 'cause I’m gettin' tired too
The rain is feelin' heavy and the sky isn't so blue
Pills for my breakfast, promisin' they'll heal me
Hanging out with doctors and starin' at the ceiling
My favorite days are Mondays, when you come and see me
Wish you would stay longer but I know it's not easy
Yeah, I was excited for that concert
Tell me all about it, did they sign your new Converse?
I don't wanna let go when we hug
One thing worse than dying is losing who you love
It's okay to say goodbye
But I hate saying goodbyes
Would you stay here longer?
Sorry I'm not stronger
Noticed all the pain you had to deal with
Was sick of all the doctors lyin', sayin' that you'd heal quick
It's been a couple days since you left us in that hearse
Your girl just called me, said she's pregnant and that would've been my first
So shocked when she told me
Why didn't she tell you?
She thought you'd leave the world thinkin' your promises have fell through
You always talked about how you were ready for a son (For a son)
Now you'll be watchin' over him, free of pain
Hope that one day he'll look up and feel your love (Look up and feel my love)

When I get to heaven I will wait for you
Sorry for the things that I put you through
You had to watch me flatline, wishin' that we had time4Embed",13694.0,​when the hospital was my home,['Rxseboy']

Underneath street lights where we would kiss
Who thought that hearts could break?

R.I.P. my niggas, love them boys like they still alive (R.I.P. my niggas)
MarMar did five, came home, brodie went right back
Shit made me sad, I just wanted bro to get the bag
State dropped the case (Damn), that mean we gotta fight the feds
Even if we down, we gon' make sure we hold up our heads (For sure that)
Seventy percent of my niggas gotta sleep on mats
We can't talk for more than fifteen minutes 'less they call me back
Gotta use they clothes as a pillow, what you know 'bout that?
Cold bitch, I only hit her once, but she came back-to-back (That's a fact)
Street took my pops, police gave me back my mama
Today, I see a little peace, it used to be just drama
My niggas went from gettin' suspended to gettin' indicted

Tried to throw it in reverse, boy, we threw his shit in park (Skrrt)

Think you got the drop, send your nigga through and get him clapped (Send 'em)
Buffs look like white on rice (Buffs look like white on rice)

I was watchin' my parents baggin' up grams, dreamin' 'bout McLarens
I was facin' thirty, kept quiet, ayy, can you do that? (Can you?)

Matter fact, scratch was, I'm still on bullshit (I'm still on bullshit)

Bitch, we be outside so much, niggas think we homeless (We out here)
When I catch your mans, I'm goin' stupid (Dumb)
Can't rap about the details 'cause I'm gon' really do it
Bitch, that money long as train smoke (Bitch, that money long as train)
Fuck just him, I want his gang smoke, ayy (Fuck just him, I want his gang)
I got a new crib (New crib), but I call that bitch my old-school (My old-school)
'Cause that bitch the same size as my old school (Cody High)
I moved to Cali, they like, ""Come back to the trenches""
I got plugs out here, bro, pop out and fly back with them bitches (Come get 'em)
Gang takin' niggas hoes, they like, ""Come back with our bitches"" (Come back)
Don't even trip, they gon' be back, but in a minute, nigga (Calm down, nigga)

(Jose the Plug)
Talk to 'em
I'm just chillin' at the crib, right?
This shit fuckin' me up
You gotta talk to 'em, man

Lookin' at my son like, ""Damn, I got a human"" (This shit real)
'Member when I felt you in your mama's stomach movin' (I do)
Lookin' at my jewelry like, ""Damn, I'm really stupid"" (That's crazy)
Lookin' at my past like, damn, man, I been through it (It all)
Lil' brodie came home from jail and he crashed (Damn)
Then brodie called home from jail and he laughed (What's up, nigga?)
Gotta match my nigga energy, I can't be sad (I can't)
We ain't trippin' on no time, bitch, you know we built to last (You know that)
I see niggas be who they wanna be on the 'Gram
I see bitches with the niggas that they said they ain't had (Damn)
I was in the ninth grade yellin', ""Get a bag""
Catchin' contacts packin' up the boy without a mask (I remember)
Gettin' fast money
That shit you pullin' out on camera, that's my gas money (That's light)
God, how I make it here? I just ain't had nothin'
Sittin' in the bullpen starvin', eatin' bag lunches
On my way to court 'cause I was movin' like a crash dummy (Was crashin' out)
Gotta hold myself accountable (Yeah)
If God don't exist, then how I make it through these obstacles? (Tell me that)
I ain't do it on my own, that's impossible
I was prayin' hard for this shit, that's what you gotta know
Don't gotta like me, but respect me, that's what you gotta do
'Cause I'ma try to put you in the morgue, fuck the hospital (Nigga, you outta here)
And puttin' trust in niggas been risky (It has)
I was a lil' nigga knowin' niggas been iffy like (I do)
I would let niggas get rich with me (I would)
But they'll run off with a quarter 'stead of tryna build a brick with me (Fuck 'em)
Don't even kill 'em, let 'em watch us get litty
While he walkin', we gon' ride Forgis on the 650, bitch (Turn up)
Big Grizzley, fuck with me, bad bitches, fuck plenty
Me and bro just made a cut face, that's a buck-fifty
Play with me, duck fifty, if it's up, it's stuck with me
Glock 27 stuck to me and it bust quickly

Lookin' at my son like, ""Damn, I got a human"" (This shit real)
'Member when I felt you in your mama's stomach movin' (I remember)
Lookin' at my jewelry, brodie like, ""You goin' stupid"" (You goin' crazy)
Lookin' at our past, I'm like, ""Brodie, we been through it"" (Ayy, for real)
Baby Grizz came home from jail and he crashed (Damn)
But we can't forget, before he left, he got the bag (He did)
And he still rich, hope you don't think he in there sad
We ain't trippin' on no time, bitch, you know we built to last (Nigga, you know that)
I see niggas be who they wanna be on the 'Gram
I see bitches with the niggas that they said they ain't had
I see niggas without the bag they said that they had
And for some reason I believed them, I'm like, ""Damn"" (Niggas cap)
Ain't paranoid, I'm just on high alert (Alert)
Smokin' weed to numb the pain, yeah, I'm high and hurt
Can't no clinic pills help you when that chopper burn
Like an STD, but that's just how some people gotta learn (Go get 'em)
Ayy, I ain't scared of nothin' roamin' this Earth
If somethin' scare me, it's gon' go in the dirt (You hear me?)
'Member sleepin' at the trap, they used to line up at the door on the first
I'm with the nigga that put your bro on a shirt (He right here)
Let me talk about my past
Abusive household, multiple failures (Facts)
Ramen noodles kept us from starvin', I'm tryna tell you (Facts)
Headaches, stomachaches, nigga, heartaches
Turn you into shark bait 'bout our cake
Let's talk about my future, though
Now we excited 'bout what the future hold
Trips out the country, we done got used to those
Bustdowns, got a few of those (Got a few of those)
These bitches see us and they do the most
Don't play with us or it's your funeral (Don't play)
Back to my past, show these niggas where we came from
Fightin' for nothin', we was just tryna get our name up
Now we tryna get our change up
You do that, they say you changed up
We just told our story, never tried to get our fame up
Lame nigga, I'm in that foreign doin' the dash (Doin' the dash)
How you gon' stop some niggas that's built to last, huh?

True story
Based on true events

I was like thirteen (Young), saw my uncle trappin' (Unc’)
Pulled him to the side, told him, ""Show me how to bag it"" (How you do that?)
He like, ""When you get that money, nigga, stack it"" (For lawyers and shit)
He gave me that bag, I jumped in traffic
And my grandma like, ""Quit runnin' out my house, lil' boy, you in or out?"" (Close the door)
I pulled out them racks, give her a stack, after that I ain’t hear her mouth (Here, granny)
Granddad wasn't fuckin' with it, I'm like, ""Granddad, hear me out (Man)
Ain't nobody gon' give us shit (They ain't)
Go on 'head, let me get this shit"" (Let me get it)
He like, ""Fuckin’ with your uncle gon’ get you in trouble"" (No)
I'm like, ""Fuckin’ with my uncle gon' make this shit double"" (Get money)
I got clientele that stretch from Southfield down to Hudson (I'm on)
I'm young, but ain’t nobody gon' take nothin', I got muscle (They gon' die)
Come in short or tryna cop on credit, that shit dead (That's over)
You can't show no weakness in these streets, go bust his head (Go kill 'em)
Way before they came out with the kush I had the regs (The corns)
Come and get a pound off the bale, bring a band, ayy (Pull up, nigga)
Had to throw it runnin' from the cops, I need another Glock (Damn)
Answerin' my phone, not sayin', ""Hello"", I'm sayin', ""How much you got?"" (How much you got, bro?)
Callin' my lil' plug, goin' off, like, ""Where the fuck you at? (Man)
That work that I just got ain't jumpin' back, I need my money back"" (I'm 'bout to pull up)
I was on the block, bitch, trappin' with my pistol (Trappin')
Wasn't goin' to school, I was trappin' with my pistol (Fuck that, I'm trappin')
Wasn't fuckin' with hoes, I was trappin' with my pistol (Fuck that, I'm trappin')
The whole hood know that I was trappin' with my pistol (I'm out here)

Watchin' Fresh Prince, I need a crib like Uncle Phil (I need it)
Feds came and kicked my granny door, it's gettin' real (Buck)
My pops came and got me, he like, ""Nigga, you a kid, be a kid""
And that's exactly what I did, I just quit trappin'1Embed",,Quit Trappin,

(Hit-Boy)
Had to take my jewelry off for this shit, man
Na, na-na, na-na
Had to take my money out my pocket and everything, before I even start rappin'
Ooh yeah
Just so I get that feel again, you know what I'm sayin'?
Na, na-na, na-na, na
Back to that grind, that hunger
Not like everybody else that's rich (Ooh-wee)

The last shit I dropped was some industry songs I thought was gon' be lit
Now I know if I keep doin' that, I ain't gon' be shit (I tried it)
I can't make that shit y'all hear from Drake and them
The people that relate to me do not relate to Taylor Swift (Uh-uh)
So I apologize (Apologize)
For comin' to the studio and seein' dollar signs (Dollar signs)
Instead of bein' real with y'all, like how I'm traumatized (Traumatized)
The shit that happened to JB hit me so hard, it made my mama cry (Damn)
Speakin' of my mama, yeah, she still got a lot of time (Uh-huh)
Lost my great granny, we knew she was almost out of time
I ain't cut them niggas off for nothin', they was out of line
Niggas rappers 'til the feds have 'em singin' like Ty Dolla $ign, ayy (Ooh yeah)
I ain't no rapper, I'm an artist
Ain't in and out of jail, so I gotta be the smartest
Plus I'm seasoned like Lawry's
Put the guns down from my past, now I'm a target
Had to pick the guns back up case they start sparking (Boom)
Real peace, I'm tryna get closer to it
I can't find that in money 'cause I be blowin' through it
Free my commissary niggas and that bitch goin' through it
Few M's in cash, bet you can't get to know me for it (Uh-huh)
The real side of me (Real side), it's a broke me (Yeah)
And the rich me owe him an apology
Really I hit the lottery (I did)
And instead of being grateful, I just see people winnin' and let it bother me (I did)
Kylie made a billion, I'm failin' in life, I gotta be
She younger than me, so I'm 'posed to have more money logically
Then I start thinkin' like that shit don't apply to me
Kylie Jenner came from millions, I come from poverty (Come from poverty)
Anybody born into money, they supposed to
You was gon' be dead at twenty, that's what they told you (That's what they said)
But instead you got rich and fucked all the hoes that hoed you (All of 'em)
Now it's time to make sure you don't go back to the old you (No, you can't)
Now I understand (I understand)
I'm me, so I ain't nothin' like no other man (Tee Grizzley)
When they was buyin' 'fits and never wearin' clothes twice
I was at auntie house, tellin' Lau', ""Give me everything you don't like""
What I got in common with these other rappers? Nothin', nigga (Nothin')
They make theyselves feel real by hangin' with bummy niggas
Pull up to the trenches, take some pictures, let 'em clutch the blicky
That's why I be irritated when I gotta fuck with niggas (On my mama)
I'ma tell you the truth (Man, the truth)
They lettin' niggas get some money, all that other shit is through
I got bitches, got my niggas, I got millions in the stu'
Trade my mansion for a cell over some clout, boy, would you? (Boy)
But let you tell it, you quick to blast, gon' flip his ass
Life in prison, no more pussy, only nigga ass (That's it)
Only six packs (That's it), only calf muscle (That's all)
Them niggas ain't tryna make love, they 'bout to wrap somethin'
That shit funny, but it's true
Better grow a brain 'fore it be you ('Fore it be you)
Better think 'fore you try to be cool (Tryna be cool, nigga)
Better look for some cameras before you shoot
I was that nigga before I had the cash (Yeah)
In the club with my bitch, still grabbin' ass (Come here)
God told me, ""Son, I'm not sendin' you to Hell""
Even though I killed whoever caught 'em when I threw them shells (Amen)
Don't let this go over your head
I wouldn't've told on nobody and I wasn't goin' to jail, nigga (You hear me?)
Don't let this go over your head
I wasn't tellin' on nobody and I wasn't goin' to jail, nigga

Nigga killed my auntie, let me live, boy, you foolish
When you die and go meet her, she gon' tell you you stupid
If these pussies got a problem, you know I got a solution
We gon' do it like math, subtract everybody included
I like fuckin' bitches soon as we meet
Only street nigga from the D made more money than me was Meech
First one go touch a hundred without goin' to jail is me
Only nigga with a song hard as ""First Day Out"" is Meek
Boy, you sweet
Heard you let them niggas rob you, we gon' rob you too
But they ain't shoot you, when I rob you, I'ma pop you too (Boom)
He ain't drop yet off the Glock, shoot the chopper too (Brrt)
I'll fuck a nigga main bitch, side bitch too (Both, nigga)

More money, more bitches
More millis, more riches (What else?), yeah, yeah (Nigga)
Bendin' corners on a four-wheeler (We ain't done yet, hold up)
Made some more money, so I bought some more killers, yeah, yeah
Hold up, wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished? (Hold up)
Hardest chain in the game, this shit all in Guinness
How you gon' get ahead, you keep runnin' off on niggas?
I got 'em sick like I had a cold and coughed on niggas
I'm the same nigga from Joy Road with them dreads, yeah, them locks (Gang)
When I was 'round, they stayed in 'cause the clip curled on the chop (Bang)

This shit was handed to you boys, I got it out the dirt with mine
Yeah, nigga, out the mud, clutching walking out the club
Nike slides, T-shirt on, still can pull out a dub
Spilled some food on my shirt, ain't worried with the stain on it

Lot of extras in my clip like fries at Five Guys
Neck on Dairy Queen, my wrist on Häagen-Dazs (Ice)

Some people love me so much, you would think we related
Some people hate me so much, you would think we wasn't related

And I dropped them hoes off after they hopped up off it (I did it)
I probably dropped a couple dollars on 'em (I did)
And I be talkin' so much shit, I probably dropped some knowledge on 'em
Like somebody prayin' for me, gotta be my sweet grandma (Amen)

He get some money for some clothes, he tryna buy some poles (All of 'em)

Wouldn't have ran, would've smoke the Runtz and watch that man go to sleep

You know everything a nigga say be facts man like
I hope they don't play this shit in court one day
If you look up some of the stories in my city
You will see the relation between the music

Everybody with me clumsy, we all be droppin' shit
Droppin' niggas, droppin' icy kids
Fuck a bitch, drop her at her momma crib
Not with the gossipin', we do that robbin' shit
Any means, I'm gon' eat
Slide with the tank on full (Yeah)
Leave with the Glock on E
I got a K, it hold a hunnid
But I got lazy, only put 90
Money make your whole team vanish
That's a paper trick, Origami
I be dolo, don't need a posse
If you got the wave, I got the tsunami
Chain hit like Ike Turner (What else?)
But I don't beat bitches, I beat bodies
I just bought some chain reactions just to stomp a nigga in Versace
Call me Martin, I stay with the Tommy
You lookin' for me, pussy come find me
And I'm not gon' snatch your chain, I'm gon' take it off politely
So when I go back to sell it, it's not damaged, not even slightly
Raised around killers, that's how I'm cut
Found out where he stay, don't shoot the house up
Lay in they bushes 'til your legs lock up
Whoever walk outside first, drop some
Lift that chopper up, go nuts (Go nuts)
That was his momma, so what? (Fuck it)
Nigga that's your fault, we wanted your blood
And your bitch take dick like a grownup
I'm a product of them streets (Yeah)
Sharks and hustlers, I'm from the D (Yeah)
Bring a nigga to the feast (Yeah), we not stingy, homie eat
He get greedy, put him to sleep
They gotta identify him by his teeth
We gon' kill you if you freeze
When your job was to squeeze, nigga
I got an Uzi and sound like, boom! (Ooh)
I got a Draco and it sound like, boom! (Sheesh)
Knock your shit open, the bullets explosive
Fall and you getting stood-over (Come here)
Can't run out of bullets in a shootout
Taking my time counting as I'm blowin'
Yeah, drumsticks, guitar-sized AR's, we a little band
Rapper diss me, I'm at every show like I'm his biggest fan
Hollows in that Sprinter Van gon leave somebody crippled, man
You see your DJ brain come through his head
You'll turn religious, man

No Airbnb, I bought that cash
Dapper dan walk, that's vintage
Retired the streets, no pension
Back and forth in a race, no tennis
To my ex-hoes, no hard feelings
Paid for that Brazilian lift, now it look better when she twerk
I'm with the threesomes, you gon' get credit for participation, but you gotta work
Say her nigga ain't got cash, here go a ten, go get you a purse
Street niggas for the win, it look better when we first
Hundred racks in that Goyard, bitch, I want both of y'all
They kicked our door in, we already sold it all
I left her soul scarred, tryna race like go-karts
Can't go back broke, dawg, my life was so hard
Fuck with a boss, I don't just talk
Baby, I walk it but I don't ever walk

Jump out the whip, then come off the waist

I think that's when all this shit got started

On Chicago, when some niggas rolled up in a Charger (Skrrt)

Bruh like, ""That's them 7 Mile niggas,"" so that's our target
Next day we on 7 Mile and Ferguson with five .40s
Tell his mama her baby gettin' aborted
No statute of limitations, so I gotta end that story
Put the gang on our shirts, you know what my mans claim
Terrorizin' shit, from Northland to Fairlane
Gettin' all the hoes at the high school games
Bunch of young niggas with some frames that'll go insane
Then that RICO Act came, that's when niggas changed
My day one niggas dead or stuck in that cage
My day ones that's out, they don't wanna change

So it's a shame I can't even call Dub
I like to call baby, like what's the word? Chillin', I ain't on shit tonight
She gonna come through, get me right
And I'ma crash through it like she ran the light
Well, I gotta go before I miss this flight (I'm gone)
So I'm tryna get up (get up)
I'm like a kid before Christmas night
Who ain't never had none in his life, like
This really my life with zero exaggeration
Some niggas just elevated, got me feelin' activated
Lost a lot in them cells and cages but held on to my dedication
The money got me fascinated, saw that shit and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
Saw that money and got activated
I saw that money and got activated

Canada Goose keep me warm in my cold city (Detroit)
I got a pole with me, Glock cost 450
Your bitch blowin' (she's drunk), took my soul with her (suck it)
They got they hand out (what?), I don't even know niggas
For testing the game? I'm testing my aim
If I die today, I got a M to my name
In 2015, ain't have a stack to my name (broke)
Cuz let me starve, sent him a pic in a new Mulsanne
Tell him I saw the money and got activated

What your jewels cost? What that coupe cost?
I need two vaults, I'm the new Hulk

Too much money, I need like two vaults (I need two)
Stacks big and green, I call my pockets the new Hulk
We don't pay attention to no loose talk (nah)
Shoot that choppa hundred times, I had to let it cool off (brrrah!)
Diamonds dancin' on me, doin' the moonwalk (drip)
Can't wear my AP, I had to let it cool off (drip)
Almost died from pneumonia, had to take my jewels off (drip)
We don't argue with these niggas, we just let them tools talk (brrrah!)

Hit your bitch and give her back, now she yours again (she yours)
Back to back in them Ferraris, we stay horseplayin' (skrrt)
Run up on us and the morgue gon' have corpses in
Harvard student doin' my taxes, I got dork friends
I put rings on them hundreds, bitch, I married them (bitch, I married them)
You see my niggas, money and ice everywhere on them (that shit everywhere)
And we fuck each other's hoes 'cause we don't cherish them (that's a fact)
But we don't leak out that info, we can't embarrass them (we got y'all covered)
Can't leave the country, but I got my beat from London (got my beat from London)
These niggas talk but see me out and ain't on nothin' (ain't on shit)
I'm in the stu, I need a Perc', go get the runner

I don't drink, but it's for sale, we got pints in (we got pints in)
We got Tech in (we got Tech), we got Act' in (we got Act')

Put my whole neck on ice, that's what my jeweler did
Bust down paw, bust down bear, all of my charms
Patek on my left, AP on my right, all on my arms
Miami too hot, tell the plug get 'em to Boca Raton
Just got off parole, I hit the dope once, I choked up a lung
Take a nigga bitch, get deep in (deep in), Instagram hoes wanna meet him (wanna meet me)
If she ain't talkin' 'bout eatin' him (bitch eat it), leave that bitch in the DM
Just had a meeting with Diddy (Diddy), Durkio took me to Izzy
I go to sleep in Y3 (sleep), used to mix Nike with Dickies (facts)
Came a long way from my city (Detroit), I made it outta them trenches (them trenches)
Used to wear my uncle's hoodies and fitteds, even though I couldn't fit 'em
Now I'm at Lou's Deli with the Glock out, lookin' for niggas, they not out
I'm killin' them niggas, they pop out, big chop stick get knocked down

Don't even trip, you know where she at
I just want the top, I'll Uber her back
This big ol' clip in the way of my drip
Diamonds they hard, I busted my lip
If I feel disrespected, this Draco gon' rip
I got the foreigns and guns like TIP
Ye, two hunnid grand (what it do?), broke my rubber band (damn what else?)
Half a ticket cash, it won't fold, won't bend (what my wrist cost?)

While everybody talkin' down, I'm up, bitch
I ain't goin' broke, I'm stuck rich (oh, I'm stuck)
Call your bitch, like, pull up and do that one shit (pull up)
Talk to her while I fuck, make her cum quick (you like that)
AP, new freezer, I'm too lit (I'm lit)
All my haters need a hospital, they too sick (them niggas too sick)
I put my chains in the freezer, they too lit (they icy)
Somebody get them boys a hospital, they too sick

If a nigga talk crazy, hit that kill switch (go get it)
How you hate a nigga that do all real shit (real nigga)
My lil' brother comin' home to a mil' ticket (welcome home)
The people get me in that room, I ain't gon' spill shit
All the real bitches think I'm heaven sent (heaven sent)
My lil neph' growin' up, he turned 11 quick
But he can't drink none of this pop because it's medicine
I had to get rid of my .40, that bitch evidence
How Tee a gangsta? He stole laptops
After First Day Out got down, he ain't gon' be back hot
Don't think I'm gangsta when you see, test it, watch this MAC pop
In that drop-head, tell my haters suck a fat cock
I ain't good at sellin' drugs, I done tried it (I tried it)
I'm too lazy for scales, bitch, I tried it (I done tried it)
I got rich off tellin' stories how my life went (real shit)
Bring the loyalty, one hundred, bitch, we locked in (real shit)
In that cell musty, couldn't believe myself (God damn)
Lawyer wasn't doin' shit, I had to free myself (nigga fired him)
Pops left the world earlier, had to teach myself (RIP)
Niggas out here lookin' crazy, they should see theyself (niggas crazy)
I know bro would give me half if I needed it
Bro cool but that boy'll turn demon quick
'Cause, when it's beef, make sure you don't sleep on that (What up Beau)
My dawg tried to line me up, he think I'm sleep on that
While you niggas talkin' down, I'm up, bitch (bitch I'm up)
I ain't goin' back broke, I'm stuck rich (hey, we stuck)
He tried to hide her but I still hit that dumb bitch (dumb bitch)
One night and then I'm done with that punk bitch (bitch get outta here)
Only one of me but ho, I'm doublin'
I put his mans in the morgue, I know he double sick
Ask about me in the clubs, nigga, I double tip
I'm runnin' shit, whoever don't like it, suck a dick (big money)
Bitch, when you see a boss keep twerkin' (keep twerkin')
Keep doin' that and you gon' be my next purchase (yeah)
60 racks to NZ for this choker, I can merch it (yeah)
Ass so soft, titties right, you perfect (yeah)
Pussy so wet it make waves, we surfin' (hol' up)
Nigga in your DM three times, he thirsty (thirsty)
Used to be broke, catchin' buses, I was bummin'
Now when bitches see me out they like, ""It's a husband"" (it's a husband)
Girl don't thank for that cash, it's just money (it's just money)
Don't even thank me for that bag, it ain't nothin' (it ain't nothin')
He don't buy bags, who he foolin'?
That nigga bag little, he ain't tryna blow through it (haha)
You got a table full of niggas but it's one plate (it's only one plate?)
I don't even fuck with Unk and even old Ye' (hoe ass nigga)
This old nigga told me, boy, you should love hate
'Cause nigga you wouldn't be poppin' if they wasn't hatin'
Hold up, when I was broke I never blamed God (thank you Lord)
That's why every back end, I thank God (God I love you)
They said I wouldn't make it but they ain't God (they just talkin')
That's why I say, ""Ain't it a blessing,"" gotta claim God (Ain't it a blessing)

I'm just curious, niggas can't be serious
Woke up like, ""What year is it?"" Niggas on their period
My change done gave me somethin', it ain't no curin' it
I seen Durk, I heard up close, bitch ain't no fear in it

My name superior
Bro and 'em be trappin'
They throwin' a couple hundreds just so you can deliver it
You said if he robbed you that you was gon' kill him
I seen him today, I'm just curious
I told her don't put me on child support, I'ma give extra but she wasn't hearin' it
I take you around the killer, the robbers, the shooters just for the experience

Don't try to dodge you, make up yo bed, you lay in it, niggas ain't hearin' it
I get yo bitch in the Bentley, she gon' see some shit she never experienced
I am a Captain, I get you crunched and put in a box, no cereal
This automatic hit that whip, nothing gon' help niggas short of a miracle
Tryna to make a million off a Bloodas tour but his P.O. not clearin' him
Tryna make a M and M but he couldn't do it and that shit was killin' him
And I grew up in the ghetto, I ain't never hung around gentlemen
Bought the drugs, take the drugs, niggas in the hood ain't really tryna get it
You would be surprised what your brothers do (Uh)
Don't be surprised for this Bloodas 2 (Uh)
Couldn't feel my face when I popped that ecstasy
Couldn't feel my face off Percs, I just took 3

And my lil' bro could've died next to me (Ayy)
But I shot first, get him a stretcher please (Ayy)
Them chopsticks got his body ten degrees (Ayy)
Someone should've told him we part Japanese (Ayy)
Bro by the mill, he tryna catch the weed (Ayy)
This bitch tryna get me to invest in weave (Ayy)
I told her, ""Yes,"" just to finesse that freak (Ayy)
After I fuck, I'm playin' hide and go seek

I done been through so much shit in my life
I be askin', ""When the pain stop?""
Used to ride to school, Mongoose, now in a Range drop (Skrrt-skrrt)
Is you is who you say you is?
You can't be who you is, you play with Grizz'
You play with Durkio, you pick out your box
I'm good on my block, good on O-Block (Ayy)
They in they feelings 'cause I smoke on opps (Ayy)
I hope they know 100 shots ain’t gon' stop
I just been tryna save it, they keep on makin' it hard
They keep on makin' us jewelry, they keep on makin' these cars
That pump hit him, it's gon' lift him up and that nigga gon' make it to Mars
On track to confirm that shipment should make it tomorrow

50 to 100 stacks on yo head, I bet you won't make it tomorrow
Let me know your crib all night, no sleep, they drinkin' Starbucks
I'm talkin' boss life, you say my name one time, I'ma tell 'em I fucked your boss wife
I nut on her cheek, she wipe her face off with my Off-White
I forgave you but that love made me (love made me)
I popped some ecstasy that Thug gave me

Boonk got a lawyer from Cali
He say when he finished, he droppin' Philippe (that mixtape)
I went and blew out a Rollie, won't no nigga take it from me
Don't put your trust in these niggas or cuddle with bitches, bro, take it from me
Choppin' it up with big homie, he said don't try and outdo the city
Outdo niggas out of the city that's in the industry, you outgrew the city
I signed a deal with 300, now the hate comin' out of you, nigga
But it ain't no problem, my nigga, 'cause they choppers will fly through you, nigga
Broke before I got locked up, I was fucked up when I got out of prison
I ain't heard half of these niggas or bitches and don't 'member gettin' a dollar from niggas

Alright then, make it easy for me, five million in a month
Cold bitch say I'm well-spoken, spit a thousand bars, I ain't lie once
Last night I saw 50, it all belong to me
After I hit your bitch, can you come pick her up, I can't keep her with me
These niggas that's with me, they go RiRi for me
They'll work-work-work-work-work them choppers 'til I tell them to cease
Lawyer wanted 10 just to show his face
Before I had a Snapchat, I had an OTIS page
Before I had a Periscope, I had a JPay
Before this well done steak it was a state tray
First time I shot a gun, it was at a nigga
High School when I saw my first 10 bands

But really they don't even like you
What your city like?

Shit, I'm from the city of Hoover
Bump and slide, we was robbin' the jeweler
I was in school but shit had made me a shooter
What your city like?

I'm from the city of Kwame
Clean up the scene, wipe off the choppers
And drive to the lake and get rid of the bodies
What your city like?

Shit, we do not honor no OG
They smoke you and turn you to OG
Had that young nigga take that case, he juvy
You must be stupid think you gang gang, boy your ass a goofy
Know some bitches that be crackin' giffys, they be boostin'
What your city like?
Shit, foe'nem be stuck in the trenches
30 extensions, you can hit with the (?)
You know we gon' rob with the 50
Why you tweakin', nigga?
Foe'nem be ridin' in steamers
Lookin' for lackers, lookin' for niggas off perkys, niggas always be leanin'
What your city like nigga?

If it get like that then it get like that
Beef slide down we gon' get right back
Nigga just like that
Got locked, told niggas I'ma be back
Soon as I got back got three plaques
Opps on Twitter, we ain't gon' tweet back
I'ma pop off broad day, no ski mask
My city where the pirhanas at
Jump in that water and drown in that
I hit Kentucky with three hundred grams for five days and bring ninety back
I started off with a ninety pack
Such and such, he can vouch for that
Can't say his name all over these tracks
'Cause that nigga know where the body at
What your city like nigga?
Shit, we take the drugs to Iowa
Home the swiper
When you a gangster don't go off a title
I know some opps that's scared of the bible
Yeah yeah, pick up the Glock and put down the rifle
Seventeen with a seventeen
This ain't back then, we not fighting

Can't come to our cities, they know what's up with 'em
Cool with the killers, they really my niggas
They opps mobs, can't fuck with them niggas
Durk on his way to Detroit, better call me soon as you hit
I'ma put choppers around you, my nigga don't even trip

Shit you on the way to the Chi? I'll link you up with the six
Shit, two Glocks shawty wrong, yeah you gon' ride with them sticks
And I know your ass on parole, so two Glocks in the dip
And I heard blood turned crip, olympic medal how he flip
Aye T, put me on them Detroit bitches

That shit gon' be easy, only thing they hate is decoy niggas
You ain't gotta check in the hotel, my nigga just come to the crib
As far as the hoes, you fuckin' off rip, they know who you is
Tell Booka I'ma get him a bitch that got her some paper
'Cause rich hoes love real niggas, they don't need 'em to save her
I'ma get up with you later, I gotta go see my agent
Next time I come to Chi make sure you return the favor

I'ma return it
Put on a condom, she burnin'
How the fuck you know she burnin'?
Shit, I heard that she burnin'
She must don't know me yet, think I buy her a Birkin bag
Bitch, your lil twerkin' ass
You ain't even worth a bag, yeah nah

When you get money, they scared of you
Ain't this shit crazy, we federal
Hang around me, just to better you
And I put dope on the avenue
I'm off the gas, no edible, 25k for medical
I keep a dirty cup, I keep a dirty stick
My old head 36, went down for 30 bricks
He ain't even take his lil' dirty bitch
Disrespect is not tolerated
Give you money, I'm not obligated
Tom Ford not 
I see my jewelry at a round table
We was broke, we ain't had cable
Sippin' syrup like Aunt Mabel
Told 'em thank you, ain't ungrateful
If I hate you, I can't unhate you
Seem like snitchin' contagious
These niggas broke, they unable
I just brought a chopper, that bitch dirty already
I blew a bag when I'm ready, if I don't bat, I'm petty
Bitch, ain't got time for beggin', head so good, Megan
Fuck airline, jet it, bust down time, Patek
From the trenches, scary, I'ma wake up and get it

Dirty AR pistol, hold up, dirty SK
Let the .40 with the dick bust on ya'll on camera, that's a sextape
Serial number scratched off the Glock 9, that's a fed case
Nigga keep speakin' on me, I am not worried 'bout him
Killers land on his driveway, they gon' turn up when they catch him turnin' in
A bitch told me where he stay, put his trust in a dirty bitch
Now they gonna have dinners, candle lights, 'bituaries, and some searches for him
 be stuck in the trenches 'cause I'm on parole
And the only time I can get out is if it's for a show
And they niggas they want my top, I can't go
So if you see me out with a top, I'm not wrong
I keep a dirty stick, Durk got like 30 sticks
Some got 50s on 'em, some got 30s in 'em
We out here purgin' wit' 'em, we is not nervous wit' 'em
This dirty stick will put you in the earth, now you a dirty nigga

I barely go on dates, so I hold yo' hand
Even if I grew up with him, I don't know yo' man
'Cause if I say I know him, I might blow my chance
Take you to the heart of the trenches, ain't no romance
We not together, but we make it official
This lifestyle forever, just make sure it fit you
Talk to me, walk with me
Kiss on me, feel on me
Sex got a melody
Grip on it, spit on it

I don't throw hoes on my page, they don't make my 'Gram
'Cause my other bitch might get mad, but I'ma take my chance (Fuck it)
Bad bitch wanna see my show, wanna bring her friends (Come on)
Put they name on the list, gotta get them in
Keepin' it lowkey, come to my meet and greet (Hello)
I'ma give you a room key, girl, go wait for me
Said, ""Fuck that nosebleed,"" she want a floor seat (She want a floor)
Wanna get close to me, what you gon' do wit' me
Know I'm move deep (Gang), bitch, I'm too street (Gang)
We not together, my baby, you just cool peeps
What yo' friend on, you know I had her before
You used to fuck with me when, I never met him before
I barely go on dates, so I hold yo' hand
Even if I grew up with him, I don't know yo' man
'Cause if I say I know him, I might blow my chance
Take you to the heart of the trenches, ain't no romance
We not together, but we make it official
This lifestyle forever, just make sure it fit you
Talk to me, walk with me
Kiss on me, feel on me
Sex got a melody
Grip on it, spit on it

I bought her ass them boy shorts she want
And we married, I do
You can blow a bag with me
I know rappers backstage
Ooh, that new Hellcat, that Fast & Furious (Skrrt)
I met her today (I swerve)
Just give me loctation (ASAP)
Why these bitches hatin'?
But these bitches basic (Facts)
I merched on J Money, I won't tell who I fucked last night (Shh)
Gotta watch out what you say to me, I smash on sight (Come here)
In the studio, got her name on my wrist right now (I know)
Forgive me what I did, I know you pissed right now (I know)
You the shit right now (Right now)
Get dick right down (Dick right down)
Put them drugs on my tongue, bite right down
I barely go on dates, so I hold yo' hand
Even if I grew up with him, I don't know yo' man
'Cause if I say I know him, I might blow my chance
Take you to the heart of the trenches, ain't no romance

This lifestyle, forever just make sure it fit you
Talk to me, walk with me
Caress on me, feel on me

Rest in peace Pimp C but let's get more hoes
She don't wanna share her secrets with me
But I know 'em already
Fuck your ex
I'ma show her I'm ready

All that shit that I did for niggas, they wouldn't have did for me
I never asked for much, keepin' it real is free
Now I'm just savin' my money, you ain't gotta deal with me
I go broke, back to the block, ain't nobody gon' feel it but me
These niggas ungrateful
Do something for a nigga, niggas won't even say thank you
Speaking down on me now, that shit disgraceful
When nobody there, I was shackled down to my ankles
Now they callin' me with they problems like I made 'em
If I wouldn't here, who would you call?
If I wasn't rich, who could I call?
My days consist of me and my circle
Even got family members who ain't worthy
They be like let me hold something 'til Tuesday, I'ma give it back
Tuesday come, niggas act like they mad when you go to get it back
Bring up what you did for me then you shouldn't did it, I get sick of that
Everything I ever did was genuine, you would never hear me mention that
Remember that, nigga

So I get to showin' niggas love, like real love (Ungreateful) pullin' up on niggas and everything, you know. (Ungreateful)
Ain't nobody from our city that made it ever did that for niggas  ,you know what I'm sayin', the trenches. (Ungreateful) I tried to be the first one to do that. (Ungreateful) Niggas still hatin' on me for that. (I did for everyone) Alright maybe niggas just broke and need some money. (Ungreateful) I get the passing (Ungreateful) cheese around that bitch, you know what I'm sayin'. (They tell me)
I'm like, 200,000 in, just with, passin' money out, you know what I'm sayin'. (Ungreateful) That shit don't work, these niggas don't appreciate shit. (Ungreateful) These niggas ungreatful
Ungreateful, ungreateful
Ungreateful, ungreateful
I did for everyone
Ungreateful, ungreateful
Ungreateful
They tell me
Niggas did bids
She made sure you was fed
Let you talk to your kids, so they can love they dad
You wouldn't say thank you
But at the same time, she was trippin' about some taxes
She ain't wanna break bread with her man, she so ungrateful
Ain't cheat just to keep you happy, I wish I was unfaithful
Let niggas hold money Friday to after Friday like I was able
I brought niggas 'round my kids, let them eat at the roundtable
Watch playoff games up at my crib 'cause you ain't have no cable
Jail visits, sending pictures I was by that
You say I'm trippin' but your family who you was mad at
Ì know some niggas who would take you out for some Xanax
Plan B, 'cause Plan A we ain't never plan that
You miss court, I let you lay low
You stole from me and ain't seen you since, I told my OG I'ma give you halo
Got that dog food like we Ralo
And they gon' kill you if I say so

Aye, I'ma tell you the truth, I'ma spit facts, I'ma tell you one time alright. My bank called me and was tellin' me like, someone just forged your, umm, your signature. So I'm like, ""Hell naw, y'all trippin'."" 20, 30 thousand dollar check ain't nobody, ain't finna know nobody gon' walk in there and do that, you know what I'm sayin'. Whole time it was my family. You know what I'm sayin', that ain't even hurt me, man, I just knew what time it was. That's why everybody I got around me I call my brother or my family, you know what I'm sayin'.

You ready?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

This is my moment, this is my moment
This what I wanted, this what I wanted
You know that I'm with it, you fuck with me, I'm goin'
When that money callin' I throw a bitch off me, I'm on it
I'm on it, nigga

I sat there and waited
For niggas to help me
All that talkin' they did, them niggas ain't show it
I sat there and starved, I remember the hunger
Ayy, when I got a plate, bitch it was over
Game over
Nigga, back the fuck off me 'fore them killers get on you
Ooh, I ain't gotta be steamin', for these bitches to blow me
Ooh, beat my case in Kentucky, but they wanted to stone me
Ooh, one time for my bitch, I won me a trophy
Ooh, Neil mama know that her son safe
'Cause at all times I'm ridin' with him
Deangelo ever get killed, I can't tell the story 'cause I'm dyin' with him
I was just broke without a dime with him
And Cody, countin' pies with him
Matchin' APs, it's our time, nigga
Feel good to be alive, nigga
I know niggas, niggas cool
Fuck 'em, I'll kill anyone
But my niggas ain't gettin' touched
If they ever call me, I'm whippin' up
Hoppin' out and I'm liftin' up
50 shots on that glizzy drum
Niggas coppin' pleas, I ain't hearin' 'em
Obituaries gettin' printed up
Ain't no beef with you niggas
You niggas can blow me
Ooh, 50 racks on me, that's after the Rollie
Ooh, I wasn't comin' home? Oh that's what they told you?
I ain't killed nobody, bitch you know they couldn't hold me
Ooh, one time for my codefendants
Nigga, everybody stayed silent
Ayy, Theo, we goin' to the grave
In assessment, nigga, we was wildin'
Ayy, Juan tho when they split us up, my blood felt like lava
Pointin' out them niggas that shot you
So I can set them niggas on fire
Ayy, Big T if you can hear me, dawg
I can't breathe without you, I'm drownin'
When Suge called with them bad news
All them tears had a nigga blinded
Ayy, mom dukes, when you fought the feds
I just knew that you was gon' beat 'em
When they gave you all of that time
It ain't hurt 'cause I couldn't believe it
But look, this is my moment
And this what I wanted
Before you fuck with me, just know that I'm with it
With whoever I'm goin'
Real niggas gon' listen 'cause I'm a real nigga
Can't nobody clone me
You fuck with my niggas, I'm comin' to get you
I swear that I'm on it

Ooh, ten bands for a feature
500 to answer my phone for you
I ain't got room for no leechers
Mothafuckas only call when they want somethin'
Niggas really out here snitchin'
Still runnin' 'round like they ain't told nothin'
And real talk, I'm scared of y'all niggas
Y'all will get a nigga Super Bowl numbers
Don't do it just for the money
You ain't gon' always get rewarded
When you one hunnid don't nothin' come with it
And when you're real you don't get nothin' for it

Watch me get this money tellin' my story

Helluva made this beat, baby

These niggas prayed on my downfall (They what?)
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Mu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?
With vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR, nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened? (We did that bitch, nigga)
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-Boom-Boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on
I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall

Shoes took a house I took your bitch, took that ho to town
Played my role so good after I hit I took a bow
Take some pounds for a pow
Take your time, take it serious
I'm curious, should I buy me a watch or a aquarium
Get your sack took, we gon' take you for a joke
If you like that last batch, bring some money take some mo'
Wanna take 'em to the 8, don't know which route I wanna take it
The country wait four years, we take presidents everyday, nigga
Take me to the horse, not the club, bitch the Porsche
Ho done took off with my dick, I should be takin' her to court
If you take me for a ho, I'ma take it to your porch
Only fear the Lord anyone else can see the morgue
Give me thirty seconds with her, I can get this bitch naked
One bullet out that K will leave the toughest nigga headless
Dawg, don't need one drug to act reckless
While he sober he'll up and put one in a nigga melon
One time for ma Dukes, one time for my pops
Free Twink, rest in peace Tee fuck the opps
One time for lil' CJ, one time for lil' Roc
50 rounds in that chop', niggas move niggas drops
One time for Juan Doe, he did that bid in KY
Play with me it's going down, bitch one time for Yung Joc
One time for CoKane Cash, nigga off top
One time for them (Brr), we got comin' by the flock, nigga
One time for a real nigga, Leek Hustle
And Leek will bust you, you a fool if you think Leek tussle

Think I work at McDonald's, I make that cheese double
Think I'm making Big Mac's, I let that bread triple
I got a big MAC, that bitch'll shred niggas
Sayin' my name better stop while your ahead
'Fore they look for your body and find nothing but your head, nigga

Say she like to throw that ass on the low, catch her
All black and it's late-night
Assault rifle with a steak knife
Big 40 eat the nigga up but the doc think it was a great white
Red bottoms on my feet like my shoes got brake light
Fuck her and drop her off, no time for no date nights
Like lil' baby, I can do this shit with no effort
You know I can do this shit with no effort
Watch me do this shit with no effort

How many niggas did they time and came home on some silent shit?
I never froze with that pistol, I was poppin' shit
Hit that interrogation room on some quiet shit
Just get me to a cell with my niggas so we can politic
And when I hit the county I was tripping on the rock
They took the TV, I don't care just don't fuck with that clock
And when I hit the prison yard, I met a lot of plugs
They saw my paper work and I got a lot of love

Only thing I told them bitches was my lawyer number

Finally rent us a Benz and they sent me down
Got lucky it wasn't for long, out of that bitch

Court cases, niggas stayed silent
To this day I thank the Lord for it
Askin' me about such and such
I ain't say nothin', too much love for 'em

I done had some conversations that can't be repeated
For the sake of some of my niggas' freedom
We done did some shit, I know so many secrets
Tell them other niggas that know 'em I hope ya’ll can keep 'em
I know about some situations I can't ever say
'Cause they can't give us life, so I can't ever break
I just pray to God I make it through the day
'Cause I done did some shit I'm takin' to the grave

It was a summer day
Niggas creepin' on us in the black car
'Round this time we was beefin' heavy
So we kept a choppa in the back part
We ended up gettin' the upper hand
I just know that hundred shots cracked cards
I'ma leave it there, I ain't say much
But I hate I even went that far
It was two of us when that popped off
Took an oath, I'ma not talk
So if the story get leaked out
I know whose face I'ma knock off
These niggas with me
When it's beef, they'll come and kill everything movin'
I'll never tell you what I think
I'ma tell you what I know, I done seen them boys do it
After it happened, it never happened
Get rid of anything that can tie us to it
Go clip for clip with my enemies
Then go wait a trial with them prosecutors
Niggas snitchin' on their homeboys
I don't see how they do it
I don't see how them niggas still livin'
I know their mans in there goin' through it
Like right, right, right, ayy
I done had some conversations that can't be repeated
For the sake of some of my niggas' freedom
We done did some shit, I know so many secrets
Tell them other niggas that know 'em I hope ya’ll can keep 'emI know about some situations I can't ever say
'Cause they can't give us life, so I can't ever break
I just pray to God I make it through the day
'Cause I done did some shit I'm takin' to the grave

Me and bro chillin', just talkin'
Told me how he blew a nigga's head back
Shit fucked me up
Stop the conversation, nigga, dead that
Whatever happened, it never happened
Don't tell none of your mans that
I ain't sayin' that your niggas rats
But I don't want you to chance that
Me and Cook talkin', what was said
It can't be repeated, nothin' about that
Can't believe them boys kept it
Hopin' people never find that
Marvin trippin' since 2012
Like lil' bro where your mind at?
Lost unc' back in '011
Granny's eyes still ain't even dried yet
Rest in peace B, I know who did it
Yeah I know you did it, nigga
You prolly can't hear me 'cause you dead too
But I don't know who killed you, nigga
Had my mama down in them feds
She said, ""Son you a real nigga""
It's your time, so I made it back home
I know how it feel, nigga

I need a whole 10 out a nigga if I jump on niggas raps

Why these niggas watching me tell em to look at cable
Before I find they bitch and fuck up they engagement
The plug said I'm half a man and half amazing
No cereal but I got twenty bowls on the table
Feeling good finally made it out them chains
Yo mans playing tough, I let you see that nigga brain's
I can get yo bitch wet before the next time it rain
You a fool you think Imma keep that forty-one plain nigga
Been in the sun getting dark the Buffs still white
Did some time made it back the prices was still right
Everything I rap about it happened in real life
You got pregnant on me baby, how you think you still wife?
Hahhh
Whenever I do that it mean I'm about activate

I talked to him today
He said ""a nigga want a track""
Charge him 10K
If they ain't got it they shouldn't be rapping anyway
If these niggas can't come up with 10 then they in the way
I'm out of prison, Let me pick up where I left it at
Got my Giuseppe in the game but I ain't finna play
Medusa head hold up my white Barbours
I don't game up these hoes I don't like talking
This ain't no motherfucking rollie

Is the same way I act while in private
I can not go to the club
If I can't get in with my fire

I was older acting young
To the pain inside I was numb
Got myself together, thank you for what I've become
Send Jesus for my sins, I know I committed a ton
Father can you help me with all my heart break
Hope you have a place for my love ones you took away
Should've died so many times but you sat me in that cage
Got me on this path, now Father help me stay

Let me give my testimony (my testimony)
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me
(I got a testimony, I got a testimony)
Let me give my testimony (my testimony)
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me
(I got a testimony, I got a testimony)
I seen so many things when I was coming up
Money, sex, death, drugs
For some crazy reason you kept me from going corrupt
Things I thought wouldn't matter you showed me it was enough
Saw my mama get life in the feds, saw my daddy dead
Nothing hurted worse even though I know they made they bed
You told me stop worrying and turned to you instead
And if I gave you my life, I'll be with him again
So let me, give my testimony
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotta start off by saying you turned your back on me
Let me give my testimony
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me

First of all I wanna say I lift you up and I give you praise

We just stopped a red G-Wagon
Driving northbound on the wrong side of the 101
Carrying fourteen suitcases full of fake, unmarked dollar bills
Bring in those suitcases full of cash
Keep 'em coming

You can save what you wanna
So much, it still feels unreal, what a waste
You spend what you gotta
Call the devil, he can put your deal in place
Take more 'til you're bloated
Too much 'til your bank account gets dumped
Check signed, duly noted
Deep pockets, but you're still a chump, don't front

We don't care what you earn
Take your money, let it burn
Laugh it off, what a joke
Watch it burning up in smoke
In a ditch, in your moat
In your castle all alone
If you're rich or you're broke
We don't care how much you own
The suspect's now passin' out Monopoly money on the off-ramp

Empty out your suitcase
Stack it up 'til it won't shut and it breaks
Tie it up with a shoelace
Fill it up like a piggy bank, don't wait
You can keep what you needed
But how bad do you need that stuff? Don't bluff
I don't think that you cheated
But it's funny 'cause it still don't all add up

We don't care what you earn
Take your money, let it burn
Laugh it off, what a joke
Watch it burning up in smoke
In a ditch, in your moat

People sleeping on the floor can be happier with nothing
Some people are so poor that all they have is money

Why my whole life
People seem so alike?
They don't mind, they fit in
""Don't stick out,"" that's bullshit

I won't wait my whole life
Watching people divide
Change your mind, don't fit in
Stick around, stand your ground

Here comes the day
That you fit into place
Or at least you can say
""Stay the fuck out my way""

Watching people divide
They change minds, don't fit in

Those cool kids stuck in the past
Apartments of cigarette ash
Wait outside until it begins
Won't be the first ones in
Spend your life waiting in line
You find it hard to define
But you do it every time
Then you do it again

Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again
Looking for signs of life
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

First kiss tastes like cigarettes
Dead man walking take your bets
Once again you lost your friends
Around and around again
Those cool kids stuck in the past
Apartments of cigarette ash
""Where are we going?""
Who did you ask?
Those cool kids stuck in the past
In a world of cigarette ash
""Where are we going?""

Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again, say
Looking for signs of life (Looking for signs of life)
Looking for signs every night
But there's no signs of life
So we do it again

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, sometimes Sunday
Love is hard, sex is easy
God in Heaven, could you please me?

You find it hard to define
But you do it every time

Some girls hate themselves
Hide under the covers with sleeping pills and

Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Some boys starve themselves
Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback

Bury me penniless and nameless
Born in a diamond mine

Born in a diamond mine
It's all around you but you can't touch it
Saying God, make me famous
If You can't, just make it painless
Just make it painless

It's not painless
She was a friend of mine, a friend of mine
And we're not nameless, oh

The white lie of American prosperity
We wanna dance but we can't feel the beat

Put your money on me
Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead
I know that you gotta be free
But I'm never gonna let it go

If there was a race, a race for your heart
It started before you were born
Above the chloroform sky
Clouds made of ambien
Sitting on carpets in the basement of Heaven
We were born innocent, but it lasts a day
And baby you can give all the money away
But if there's a race, a race for your heart
It's over before it starts

Or tuck me into bed, and wake me when I'm dead

But I'm never gonna let it go

All my presents are broken before they're open
And the promises, the second they're spoken
I know I've been different
My skin keeps shedding
My mother was crying on the day of our wedding
Trumpets of angels call for my head
I fight through the ether and I'll quit when I'm dead
If you want to know who'll be there in the end
When you bury me, baby, I'll still be your friend

Baby, what else is new?

You don't want to talk
You don't want to touch
You don't even wanna watch TV
You say I can't see the forest for the trees
So burn it all down

That ain't my only sin

You don't even wanna watch TV

Been hiding my scars in broad daylight bars
Behind laugh tracks on TV

Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
But it’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, you head inside
'Cause the lights don't work
Yeah, nothing works, they say you don't mind

But here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

And the missionaries
They tell us we will be left behind
Been left behind
A thousand times, a thousand times
If you want to be righteous
If you want to be righteous, get in line
'Cause here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
Here comes the night
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
They say heaven's a place
Yeah, heaven's a place and they know where it is
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
And when they hear the beat
Coming from the street, they lock the door
But if there's no music
Up in heaven, then what's it for?
When I hear the beat
The spirit's on me like a live-wire
A thousand horses
Running wild in a city on fire
But it starts in your feet
Then it goes to your head
And if you can't feel it
Then the rules are dead
And if you're the judge
Then what is our crime?
Here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Look out, here comes the night
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Here comes the night, the night, the night, the night time!
Now the preachers they talk
Up on the satellite
If you're looking for hell
Just try looking inside
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time

Those monitors are a little bit hot
Uh, sorry about that
Thank you guys so much for coming out, yeah
Oh man
Do you like Rock and Roll music?

Is anything as strange as a normal person?
Is anyone as cruel as a normal person?
Waiting after school for you
They want to know if you
If you're normal too
Well, are you?
Are you?

Well
I'm so confused
Am I a normal person? You know
I can't tell if I'm a normal person, it's true
I think I'm cool enough
But am I cruel enough?
Am I cruel enough
For you?
And they will break you down
‘Til everything is normal now

And they will break you down
‘Til everything is normal now

They take their tea at two, all the
The normal people, they do
They burn the jungle down
While they were sleeping, it grew
You dream in English now
In proper English, look how
You're just the same as me
It's through

And they will break you down
‘Til everything is normal now

And they will break you down
‘Til everyone is normal now

If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know

And if you hang together
You can change us, just where should you start?

You and I were born
In a little town
Before the awful sound
Started coming down
Oh no, oh

You came home from school
And knew you had to run
Please stop running now
Just let me be the one
For you

But I know you can see
Things that we can't see
But when I say I love you
Your silence covers me
Oh, Eurydice
It's an awful sound
I was so disappointed
You didn't want me
Oh, how could it be
Eurydice?
I was standing beside you
By a frozen sea
Will you ever get free?
Just take all your pain
Just put it on me
So that you can breathe
When you fly away
Will you hit the ground?
It's an awful sound

I know there's a way we can make 'em pay
Think it over and say, ""I'm never going back again.""
I know there's a way we can leave today
Think it over and say, ""I'm never going back again.""

(I’m never going back again)

And you were born
In the little town
Before the awful sound
Had started coming down
There's so much inside you
That you won't let me see
You fly away from me
But it's an awful sound
When you hit the ground
It's an awful sound
When you hit the ground
I know there's a way we can make 'em pay
Think it over and say, ""I'm never going back again.""
But I know that there's a way we can leave today
Think it over...

Woman of a certain age
Are are to feel that they've gotta change
Some of them change their faces
But they don't smile the same
Some of them take night courses
Some of them get divorces
As the world gets strange
It's time for a change

Go on, let your men get strange, mama
Go on, let the world get strange
Never change

Women of the world unite
It's all the boys, they just wanna fight
And women of the world are born
To older boys little wars
Mother, sister, daughter
The boys are just cannon fodder
It's time to take the reigns
And lead us away from the strange
Go on and let your men get strange, mama
Go on let the world get strange

You don't need what you can't carry
The flood will flow into the ocean
Their voices break with the emotion

Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified, then crucified again

In the night, they started singing
They had no right to keep believing
But down below, there's someone screaming
A broken church, no bells are ringing
Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again
Preachers talk on television
Hand out the judgements of their religion
But when I heard those women singing
They made a sound I could believe in

Crucified, then crucified again

He who strikes the blow forgets it
But he who bears the scar remembers
The fire is burning down to embers
The fire is burning but I can't remember

Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified, then crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again

Who think you've paid for your high stations
Their cities may be built in the sand
But ours were built by their fathers hands

Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
But it’s just a Reflektor (Just a Reflektor)
Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
'Cause you're my home

All right, let's go back

Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

You and I were born
In a little town
Before the awful sound
Started coming down
Oh no, oh

You came home from school
And knew you had to run
Please stop running now
Just let me be the one
For you

But I know you can see
Things that we can't see
But when I say I love you
Your silence covers me
Oh, Eurydice
It's an awful sound
I was so disappointed
You didn't want me
Oh, how could it be
Eurydice?
I was standing beside you
By a frozen sea
Will you ever get free?
Just take all your pain
Just put it on me
So that you can breathe
When you fly away
Will you hit the ground?
It's an awful sound

I know there's a way we can make 'em pay
Think it over and say, ""I'm never going back again.""
I know there's a way we can leave today
Think it over and say, ""I'm never going back again.""

(I’m never going back again)

And you were born
In the little town
Before the awful sound
Had started coming down
There's so much inside you
That you won't let me see
You fly away from me
But it's an awful sound
When you hit the ground
It's an awful sound
When you hit the ground
I know there's a way we can make 'em pay
Think it over and say, ""I'm never going back again.""
But I know that there's a way we can leave today
Think it over...

We know there's a price to pay
For love in the reflective age
I met you up upon a stage

Never know what we know
And all your makeup
Just take it all off

You say, ""I'm over it.""

I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

The kids want to be so hard
But in my dreams, we're still screaming
And running through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothing at all
Meant nothing at all, it meant nothing
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
That I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
And show her some beauty before this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot, we're still waiting, it's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's already passed
It's already, already passed

Now that San Francisco's gone
I guess I'll just pack it in
Wanna wash away my sins
In the presence of my friends
You and I, we head back East
To find a town where we can live
Even in the half light
We can see that something's gotta give
When we watched the markets crash
The promises we made were torn
And my parents sent for me
From out West, where I was born

Some people say
We've already lost
But they're afraid to pay the cost
For what we've lost
Pay the cost
For what we've lost
Now that you have left me here
I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here
In this home which has no life
Oh, this city's changed so much

Let’s go for a drive
And see the town tonight
There’s nothing to do
But I don’t mind when I’m with you

This town’s so strange
They built it to change
And while we sleep
We know the streets get rearranged
With my old friends
It was so different then
Before your war
Against the suburbs began
Before it began

Now the music divides
Us into tribes
You grew your hair
So I grew mine
You said the past won’t rest
Until we jump the fence
And leave it behind
With my old friends
I can remember when
You cut your hair
I never saw you again
Now the cities we live in
Could be distant stars
And I search for you
In every passing car
The night’s so long
Yeah, the night’s so long
I’ve been living in the shadows of your song
Been living in the shadows of your song

In the suburbs, I
I learned to drive
And you told me we would never survive
So grab your mother’s keys, we leave tonight
But you started a war
That we can’t win
They keep erasing all the streets
We grew up in
Now the music divides
Us into tribes
You choose your side
I’ll choose my side

But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight

Well, I know it’s heavy, I know it ain’t light

Been praying to a dying star

Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see

I used to write
I used to write letters, I used to sign my name
I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
But by the time we met
By the time we met, the times had already changed
So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart, I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was lost, standing in the wilderness downtown

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

And it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive

We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown

Ooh, we used to wait
Sometimes it never came
Ooh, we used to wait

A letter to my true love, I'm gonna sign my name
Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again, gonna move through the pain

Through these towns they built to change
Then you said the emotions are dead
It’s no wonder that you feel so estranged

On the reflectors of our bikes
Said “Do you kids know what time it is?”
Well, sir, it’s the first time I felt like something is mine

The summer that I broke my arm
I waited for your letter
I have no feeling for you now
Now that I know you better
I wish that I could have loved you then
Before our age was through
And before a world war does with us
Whatever it will do
I dreamt I drove home to Houston
On a highway that was underground
There was no light that we could see
As we listened to the sound of the engine failing

I feel like I’ve been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside
Of a private prison

You never trust a millionaire
Quoting the Sermon on the Mount
I used to think I was not like them
But I’m beginning to have my doubts, my doubts about it
When you’re hiding underground
The rain can’t get you wet
But do you think your righteousness
Can pay the interest on your debt? I have my doubts about it
I feel like I’ve been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside
Of a private prison
I feel like I’ve been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by and by, as I hide inside
Of my private prison5Embed",25114.0,City with No Children,

And see the town tonight

But I don’t mind when I’m with you

This town’s so strange
They built it to change
And while we sleep
We know the streets get rearranged
With my old friends
It was so different then
Before your war
Against the suburbs began
Before it began

Now the music divides
Us into tribes
You grew your hair
So I grew mine
You said the past won’t rest
Until we jump the fence
And leave it behind
With my old friends
I can remember when
You cut your hair
I never saw you again
Now the cities we live in
Could be distant stars
And I search for you
In every passing car
The night’s so long
Yeah, the night’s so long
I’ve been living in the shadows of your song
Been living in the shadows of your song

In the suburbs, I
I learned to drive
And you told me we would never survive
So grab your mother’s keys, we leave tonight
But you started a war
That we can’t win
They keep erasing all the streets

Well, I know it’s heavy, I know it ain’t light

Let the century pass me by

Been praying to a dying star

Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see

That it could see through you

I used to write letters, I used to sign my name
I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
But by the time we met
By the time we met, the times had already changed
So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart, I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was lost, standing in the wilderness downtown

Now our lives are changing fast

Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

And it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive

The king's taken back the throne
The useless seed is sown
When they say they're cutting off the phone
I tell 'em you're not home
No place to hide
You were fighting as a soldier on their side
You're still a soldier in your mind
Though nothing's on the line
You say it's money that we need
As if we were only mouths to feed
I know no matter what you say
There are some debts you'll never pay

Working for the Church while your family dies
You take what they give you and you keep it inside
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home
Hear the soldier groan, ""We'll go at it alone""

I can taste the fear
Lift me up and take me out of here
Don't wanna fight, don't wanna die
Just wanna hear you cry
Who's gonna throw the very first stone?
Oh, who's gonna reset the bone?
Walking with your head in a sling
Wanna hear the soldier sing:
""Workin' for the Church while my family dies
Your little baby sister's gonna lose her mind
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home""
Hear the soldier groan, ""We'll go at it alone""

I can taste your fear (Taste your fear)
It's gonna lift you up and take you out of here (Take you out of hear)
And the bone shall never heal;
I care not if you kneel
We can't find you now (We can't find you now)
But they're gonna get their money back somehow (They're gonna get their money back somehow)
And when you finally disappear
We'll just say you were never here

Been workin' for the Church while your life falls apart
(Your life, it falls apart)
Been singin' hallelujah with the fear in your heart
(The fear, it's in your heart)

I don't wanna work in a building downtown
No, I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't know what I'm gonna do
'Cause the planes keep crashing, always two by two
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
No, I don't wanna see when the planes hit the ground

I don't wanna work in a building downtown
I don't wanna work in a building downtown
Parking their cars in the underground
Their voices when they scream, well, they make no sound
I wanna see the cities rust
And the trouble makers riding on the back of the bus

Dear God, I'm a good Christian man
In your glory, I know you understand
That you gotta work hard and you gotta get paid
My girl's thirteen but she don't act her age
She can sing like a bird in a cage
Oh Lord, if you could see her when she's up on that stage
You know that I'm a God-fearing man
You know that I'm a God-fearing man
Well, I just gotta know if it's part of your plan
To seat my daughters there by your right hand
I know that you'll do what is right, Lord
For they are the lanterns, and you are the light

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Tell me what to say
I'll be your mouthpiece

Into the light of a bridge that burns
As I drive from the city with the money that I earned
Into the dark of a starless sky
I'm staring into nothing and I'm asking you why:
Lord, let me make her a star
So the world can see who you really are

Little girl, you're old enough to understand
That you'll always be a stranger in a strange, strange land
The men are gonna come while you're fast asleep
So you better just stay close and hold on to me
If my little mocking bird don't sing
Well, then daddy won't buy her no diamond ring
Dear God, would you send me a child?
Oh God, would you send me a child?
'Cause I wanna put it up on the TV screen
So the world can see what your true word means
Lord, would you send me a sign
'Cause I just gotta know if I'm wasting my time?

Now I'm overcome
By the light of day
My lips are near but my heart is far away
Now the war is won
And how come nothing tastes good?

Oh, you're such a sensitive child
You know, you're such a sensitive child
I know you're tired but it's alright
I just need you to sing for me tonight
You're gonna have your day in the sun;
You know God loves the sensitive ones

Oh, my little bird in a cage
Oh, my little bird in a cage
I need you to get up for me, up on that stage
And show the men that you're old for your age
Now ain't the time for fear
But if you don't take it, it will disappear
Oh! My little mockingbird sing!
Oh! My little mockingbird sing!
I need you to get up on that stage for me, honey
And show the men it's not about the money
Wanna hold a mirror up to the world
So that they can see themselves inside my little girl

Do you know where I was at your age?
Any idea where I was at your age?
I was working downtown for the minimum wage
And I'm not gonna let you just throw it all away

I am waiting 'til I don't know when
'Cause I'm sure it's gonna happen then
Time keeps creepin' through the neighborhood
Killing old folks, waking up babies just like we knew it would

All the neighbors are starting up a fire
Burning all the old folks, the witches and the liars
My eyes are covered by the hands of my unborn kids
But my heart keeps watching through the skin of my eyelids

They say a watched pot won't ever boil
Well I closed my eyes and nothing changed
Just some water getting hotter in the flames

It's not a lover I want no more
And it's not heaven I'm pining for
But there's some spirit I used to know
That's been drowned out by the radio!
They say a watched pot won't ever boil

If you still want me, please forgive me

Still the same, just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer
If you still want me, please forgive me

If you still want me, please forgive me
Because your hands are not upon me

I shrugged them off before my mom walked

In my heart there's flowers growing
On the grave of our old love

Nigga, I'm legendary, niggas better do they motherfucking research on me
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
For real

Shoutout to Birdman, he gave me my first rap check (Salute)
Slim gave me the game, gotta respect that (Respect)
I was right there with Wayne, back Carter 1
He had a Cash Money chain, shit, I wanted one

Cash Money always gon' be my family, nigga, know what I'm saying?
For real

I was still trapping back and forth to New Orleans (Yup)
I was half rapping, full-time selling kis (Trapping)
I was pistol packing, every day, it's on me (Scrap)
I was with the shit, you pull up, know I'm gon' squeeze (Blatt)
They was tryna indict me, so I moved to the A
I met Jeezy in '03, we was talking yay (Yup)
I wasn't in the hood, but still responsible for the chickens (How?)
I was sending loads to Memphis from Mexico City
Through FedEx, nigga, you hear me?
Yeah, we been getting loads in
Ain't shit changed, nigga
Real dope boy

Rest in peace to Nate (Dogg), took me to the stu' with Dre (Doctor Dre)
He ain't know I'm wanted for attempted murder case (Damn)
On the run, I ain't turning myself in (Fuck that)
Lawyer tryna make me cop a plea for the fifteen (Fuck that)
God willing, beat the case, I wouldn't have never been a rapper
Probably doing a hundred years in the slammer
Look at God, I'm in the Phantom
I put Nicki on ""5 Star"", she came hella hard (Remember)
First video she was on on 106 & Park (Facts)
You was excited 'bout being new joint of the day
Time flies, you a superstar now, congratulations

He said he'd give us a number one video, what is it?
Yo Gotti, ""5 Star""

I start to go way back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back
With Yo Gotti and E-Mack
You recall Drake saying that?
And these niggas got diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rocking furs like it's snowing in the south
Little did he know that we had birds in the drought
And I can make a million dollars selling crack rock out that house
Long story short, shoutout to Drake, he saw this shit his self
I was selling kis, no rap money, financing myself
I salute you, dog, everything you accomplished for yourself
This shit ain't easy, dog
Might be one of the best to ever do it, so you gotta ball
901, Range Line, look alive, look alive
Niggas know they play with me, I gun 'em down on this live
Disrespect me and get hit up, why the fuck you look surprised?
Out the way, tryna survive
Playing with me ain't really wise
I'm in the back of the 'Bach and I'm riding with fire (Yeah)
And the bitch on the side of me (Side of me) and the head was fire (Fire)
And they say they gon' ride with me, but I know it's a lie (I know it's lie)
And nobody gon' die with me, and nobody slide

Yeah, this my GOAT year
Bought my masters back from Epic Records, that's a souvenir
I may break a bale down on a platinum plaque (Plaque)

Mama pray for me, help me wit' this anger
What happened to my niggas
I see nothing but strangers

Gotti how it feel
Not only did you make it out
You took some niggas wit' you
That say a lot about you
Why would niggas doubt you (I don't know)
Where would Memphis be without you
How many times I prove you wrong
I didn't put on for my city
Nigga I put my city on
The streets planted these seeds
Nowadays it's like we print money
Or money grow on trees
My house feel like a hotel
Sometimes I can't believe it
Let's suffocate these pussies
Now let these niggas breath
Cuz what if this a dream
I wake back up
I'm right back in the hood (Fuck u mean)
And all I see is bushes in the yard, no palm trees
Street nigga life not fair
But that won't be a light scare
That'll be a nightmare
Blue skies
Black tint
Cavale floors
Electric fence
No suicide thoughts less it was on the doors
Feel like it's niggas wit' money vs professional whores
Palm trees, no Palm Angels
Palm trees, and a lot of angelsEmbed",,Palm Trees in Memphis,

So the street honoring lies, I wash my hands with 'em

I put plagues on the wall, I put niggas on Billboard
I done lived a life these niggas would kill for
I was feeding the babies, puttin' niggas through school
Turned trappers to execs, now they in board rooms

Now I just broke ground to build a condo down on Popular
With Gotti in the driver seat, they know nobody stopping us
Again, why would I be hatin'? Nobody hot as us

You get a plug and yo record deal

Bad bitches on us

Hellcats & Trackhawks, just to do donuts
Been tryna buy the hood
Wanna buy the Grizzlies
If I buy a bitch a Birkin
Is you gon' be in my business
I just seen myself on Shadе Room

Cuz I'm the type of nigga take 2-3 bitches to Mexico
You know Tulum
Never gon' jump that broom for real (Never)

Cuz I don't know fake from real
Get the money, feel important

We come from nothing by the way
I just fired my CPA (Fuck em)
Too much money for a safe
Type of money for an estate (Yeah)

I just want to make you my own
Yeah
I just want to make you my own
I forever love my city

House on the riverside, riding down Poplar
Niggas ain't seeing us (At all) 'less they got binoculars
I just left Prive, went to Love, I'm still popping out (What's happenin'?)
""Gotti left the city,"" I'm like, ""What the fuck you talking 'bout?""
Gotti in the city, lowkey, still popping out
Bulletproof and AR, and nigga, I'll walk you down
Gotti drinking Ace of Spade, never drink Wocky down
All my niggas talk me up and they'll never talk me down
Love for the Northside, yeah, I'm sitting courtside
Demon with the sport ties, I don't need no allies
CMG thе mafia and we do not franchise
We arе not into saving you hoes, go get baptized
We don't do the back and forth, you niggas already know it
I probably done robbed your brother, I probably done shot your boys
I flew out your baby mama
I was in her DM, I don't got her number
Coldhearted nigga, but I sponsor the hot girl summer
I just want to make you my own
See, that's what I told her, even though I was lying to her
I just want to make you my own
You know a ho, boo, you don't mean a thing

I know I'm a rich nigga, bitches wanna charge me
I'ma play the game with her, this shit make my heart beat
They like, ""You a gentleman, didn't know you was so sweet""
I just might send the bitch flowers for like six weeks
You know how we play (How)
Put her on a PJ
She never flew private
She doing shit with me in public she wouldn't even do private
I got her wide open, she don't need even know how to hide it
Let's go have a foursome, she said she ain't never tried it
I'ma post her booty, she be doing lashes
Head like she got no teeth, she should teach classes
Like me 'cause I'm so street, nah, I ain't cashing out
She know I ain't no sucker and I'ma fuck her 'til she passing out
She got a real one she be bragging 'bout
You bought her a bag, she don't respect you, I call that crashing out
Took a hood bitch out the city, called it giving back (Giving back)
A Memphis bitch in Calabasas, she don't know how to act (She don't know to act)
I just want to make you my own
See, that's what I told her, even though I was lying to her
I just want to make you my own

I'm on some cold gangster shit, I might get blocked out the industry (I am)
Ain't wifin' no hoes, no couple goals (Can't do it), and still don't feel my enemies (I am)
Ain't squashin' no beef, I'm fryin' it (Hibachi)
If it's 'bout the money, I'm tryin' it (I'm tryin', I am)
The price went high, it's thirty a brick (What 'evs)
Water been tight, flyin' in (Whoosh)
Let's say goodbye to the ghetto (Hello, hello) and welcome to wealth, 90210 (Real bitch)
Behind the gates, Mulholland Estates, I might turn this bitch to the trap though (Let's get it)
Ayy, there go the neighborhood, neighbors been bitching 'cause they heard the Lamb' in the driveway
At one in the morning, disturbing the peace, it sound like a plane when I drive 'way
Might park the Rolls on the lawn (Lawn)
Fuck it, ain't got no alarm (For what?)
New Richard Mille on my arm (Factory)
I'm a king, you a pawn (Nigga)
I'm a legend, 2Pac, Biggie, Big Pun, Wu, Raekwon (I am)
New M's to the city, in Detroit more than Big Sean (Facts)
I'm on some cold gangster shit, I got a lil' bitch on the westside
Couple lil' hitters from South Memphis and another lil' hitter from the eastside
I can adapt to the pain (Pain), I understand the poverty (Poor)
Why would I let a record label fuck over us when I did the robberies? (Never gon' happen)
They told me watch what I say in these raps (Why?) 'fore they fuck around, sentence me
And you better watch what you say out your mouth (Shh) whenever you mention me (Pew, pew)
You not relatable
I'm a street nigga and that's not debatable
Tryna buy loyalty, that's not available
I got a hundred 'round dick on this AR and I hold it stable-ble
Part II

All my bitches bad, tens, bitch on me, so what? (Fuck on)
Ho gave he head in the Benz (Yeah), bitch wanna fuck in this truck (Helluva made this beat baby)
Yeah, and I fuck her friends, shit, long as she down, I'm up
Bitch, don't ask my name, I'm doggy
Get the head twice, don't call me
Heard she got fire, I'm stalking
Beat her ass down in the office
Make her hit the highway with beans
Lean, weed, drank
Bitch run off, get painted
Ex was a ho, we ain't
Turn blood, nigga, yeah, bitch, he can't
Gotta pay me to park, no shit, I'm famous
Nigga like smoke, not me, I'm rainin'
Put in the air
Make her keep goin', then put in her hair
Link one twenty, lil' ho, these carats
Bros over hoes, ayy, bitch, we sharin'
Three-eight for the water, what they want for the 'Claren
I just bought the truck, I'm sayin' (Skrrt, no cap)
Heard you wanna fuck, take chances (Come on)
If I hit her friend, I'm playin'
Yeah, two hundred in chains, I'm dancin' (Bitch)
Fuck a nigga ho, she friendly (Ho, rat)
Own five cars, not rented (None of 'em)
None of these bitches came tinted (None of 'em)
Ask around, who run the city? (Me)
(You know who run the city)
Part III

I was just runnin' in the streets
Me and my brother, we both had an onion a piece (Both had an ounce)
Starin', I'm clutchin' my yeek (Hold up, flexin' on that bitch)
Look two more seconds, get deadly when fuckin' with me (FOREVEROLLING)
Turned all my brothers to beasts
Whether they want it or not, I'ma cut 'em a piece
I keep my gun when I'm sleep
Double the number, a hundred ain't nothin', two hundred, you done in a week
Who wanna run into me?
They really runnin' from beef
Scared to go get somethin' to eat
Can't even order in peace
Once it was war with no peace
Remember it vividly, we hit up four in a week
Who bought more order than me?
Gave you a purpose and might stick around, help you work it
I never said I was perfect, but flawless
As soon as you changed up and falling like the leaves at the end of the August
I hit it twice and he bought it
Opened her mouth and she caught it
Walkin' this shit like I talk it
Smoke with me, niggas be coughin'
Face 'em, we put 'em in coffins
First murder with a revolver
And I did it on my lonely
Big Gee, the one and only
Big Gee, the one and only
You know what I'm saying?
I ain't got no skeleton in my closet, nigga
Real street nigga, no flaw, flawless

Ayy, Leo, don't stop me, this off top part four
Alright, alright, we got it like ninety bars

Ayy, used to be the fed, now the paparazzi snapping
Ayy, everybody smoking on somebody, boy, quit capping
Somebody tell Tay Keith he a fool, this bitch slapping
Left my last bitch, what happened?
Shoutout my last bitch, what's happening?
Real nigga, never been the one to pillow talk, I never seen a pillow
Bitch told me Richard Mille or bye-bye, I'ma miss her
FN hold baby missiles, it go through your bone gristle
High security, still tote thе pistol
I don't rely on nan' nigga
Let's have somе fun with this shit
I'ma slow down the flow (Okay)
You know this CM10, this ""Shoot Off"" number four (""Shoot Off"" number four)
You see that Phantom and that Cullinan and that Wraith and the Ghost
I fuck your bitch on a plane, double back for the throat
I'm investing in crypto
I be texting in street code
Got more watches than jewelers
Want my bitches in plurals
That's more than one a time
If she ain't with it, it's fine
She know I'm busy as fuck, that's my favorite line (Shoot off)
When the beat breakdown, make me feel like I'm breaking down them pounds
And my sister  in the kitchen with that newspaper on the ground (Keep going)
When them bricks came in, me and Nero had ziplocs in them ziplocs
Standing over that stove, making that pot go do the beatbox (Go, go)
Joe Biden with the big rocks, fifty pointers in the Rollie
Trackhawk and a Redeye, none of my shit stolen
Shirt off in that XL, might go luxury, uh-huh
Know I keep it on me so don't fuck with me, uh-huh
I used to ride a four and now I'm in the Forbes
I used to step on woodgrain now it's marble floors
I miss the Honda Accord, used to have a bitch in it with the bricks in it
Rental trucks tinted with the sticks in it, yeah, I been spinning (Twenty-four left)
Yeah, I been winning, big Gotti big getting it
No feelings, drug dealing, turned that shit to a business
Solo on all my mission, want no witness or codefendants
Never put no hoes in the business
No cap, no kidding, I take this shit to the graveyard
I got a million in that Goyard
I made a half a million out my room, oh yeah, our trap booming
I'm eating noodles serving consumers
Locked in with the streets, never move off rumors
Facts only
This that Cocaine Muzik, yeah, I'm right back on it (Almost there)
Gave my nigga a hundred K, turned his back on me
Ain't no love in these streets, ain't no loyalty
How opps beefing with me but they avoiding me

I'm on some cold gangster shit, I might get blocked out the industry (I am)
Ain't wifin' no hoes, no couple goals (Can't do it), and still don't feel my enemies (I am)
Ain't squashin' no beef, I'm fryin' it (Hibachi)
If it's 'bout the money, I'm tryin' it (I'm tryin', I am)
The price went high, it's thirty a brick (What 'evs)
Water been tight, flyin' in (Whoosh)
Let's say goodbye to the ghetto (Hello, hello) and welcome to wealth, 90210 (Real bitch)
Behind the gates, Mulholland Estates, I might turn this bitch to the trap though (Let's get it)
Ayy, there go the neighborhood, neighbors been bitching 'cause they heard the Lamb' in the driveway
At one in the morning, disturbing the peace, it sound like a plane when I drive 'way
Might park the Rolls on the lawn (Lawn)
Fuck it, ain't got no alarm (For what?)
New Richard Mille on my arm (Factory)
I'm a king, you a pawn (Nigga)
I'm a legend, 2Pac, Biggie, Big Pun, Wu, Raekwon (I am)
New M's to the city, in Detroit more than Big Sean (Facts)
I'm on some cold gangster shit, I got a lil' bitch on the westside
Couple lil' hitters from South Memphis and another lil' hitter from the eastside
I can adapt to the pain (Pain), I understand the poverty (Poor)
Why would I let a record label fuck over us when I did the robberies? (Never gon' happen)
They told me watch what I say in these raps (Why?) 'fore they fuck around, sentence me
And you better watch what you say out your mouth (Shh) whenever you mention me (Pew, pew)
You not relatable
I'm a street nigga and that's not debatable
Tryna buy loyalty, that's not available
I got a hundred 'round dick on this AR and I hold it stable-ble
Part II

All my bitches bad, tens, bitch on me, so what? (Fuck on)
Ho gave he head in the Benz (Yeah), bitch wanna fuck in this truck (Helluva made this beat baby)
Yeah, and I fuck her friends, shit, long as she down, I'm up
Bitch, don't ask my name, I'm doggy
Get the head twice, don't call me
Heard she got fire, I'm stalking
Beat her ass down in the office
Make her hit the highway with beans
Lean, weed, drank
Bitch run off, get painted
Ex was a ho, we ain't
Turn blood, nigga, yeah, bitch, he can't
Gotta pay me to park, no shit, I'm famous
Nigga like smoke, not me, I'm rainin'
Put in the air
Make her keep goin', then put in her hair
Link one twenty, lil' ho, these carats
Bros over hoes, ayy, bitch, we sharin'
Three-eight for the water, what they want for the 'Claren
I just bought the truck, I'm sayin' (Skrrt, no cap)
Heard you wanna fuck, take chances (Come on)
If I hit her friend, I'm playin'
Yeah, two hundred in chains, I'm dancin' (Bitch)
Fuck a nigga ho, she friendly (Ho, rat)
Own five cars, not rented (None of 'em)
None of these bitches came tinted (None of 'em)
Ask around, who run the city? (Me)

I was just runnin' in the streets
Me and my brother, we both had an onion a piece (Both had an ounce)
Starin', I'm clutchin' my yeek (Hold up, flexin' on that bitch)
Look two more seconds, get deadly when fuckin' with me (FOREVEROLLING)
Turned all my brothers to beasts
Whether they want it or not, I'ma cut 'em a piece
I keep my gun when I'm sleep
Double the number, a hundred ain't nothin', two hundred, you done in a week
Who wanna run into me?
They really runnin' from beef
Scared to go get somethin' to eat
Can't even order in peace
Once it was war with no peace
Remember it vividly, we hit up four in a week
Who bought more order than me?
Gave you a purpose and might stick around, help you work it
I never said I was perfect, but flawless
As soon as you changed up and falling like the leaves at the end of the August
I hit it twice and he bought it
Opened her mouth and she caught it
Walkin' this shit like I talk it
Smoke with me, niggas be coughin'
Face 'em, we put 'em in coffins
First murder with a revolver
And I did it on my lonely

Locked in with the streets, never move off rumors

You ain't wanna have the threesome, you wanted to play it safe
Now you a big ol', big ol' freak, comin' out your body
Long as I got you and you got me we don't need nobody
I ain't gon' lie like I'm just perfect, go buy you some purses
Cover up the pain when I know you out here hurtin'
I'm tryna fast forward you, passport you, make a couple memories
Fuck you with no rubber, uh, make a couple mini-mes
Turn your ex to a hater, make him envy me
You know I'm locked in these streets 'til they sentence me (Yeah)
I would take you to Chanel if you want me to (If you want me to)
Put your foot over your head while I'm fuckin' you (While I'm fuckin' you)
When you say you miss me, I can't tell if it's true
So nowadays I just lie and say, ""I miss you too"" (Uh)
But I only bought you Chanel 'cause I wanted you
You let me fuck you with your friend so I don't cheat on you
You always put me in my bag, that's where I'm comfortable
And then I get another bag for her

No, no, no, no
I could tell you don't fuck with real niggas like that (No, no, no, no)
No, no, no, no
I could tell you don't fuck with real niggas like that (No, no, no, no)

Fuck being mad, I'd rather blow a bag
She said he cheated, broke her heart, she wanna pay him back
You gotta think beyond the surface, you gotta protect the brand
Every queen got a purpose, you thinking like you worthless
Fuck the purses and gifts, cars and the crib without the deeds and slips
Is it really yours? Is it really yours? I can hear it in your voice, that pussy moist
I know you think that you don't got a choice, if you want a real nigga the choice is yours
The money yours, new Porsche, Saint Laurent, Fendi, and Christian Dior (Yeah)
I would take you to Chanel if you want me to (If you want me to)
Put your foot over your head while I'm fuckin' you (While I'm fuckin' you)

Spent the bag, made you comfortable (Comfortable)

Let's get these suburban kids on they level
Better yet, these artists, whatever
My backyard like a resort
Just beat another day in court
Palm trees in the skyline

And all my bitches trained to pull bitches
And if you snitchin', nigga, keep your distance (Woo)

I may buy your girlfriend a gift
Double C's got my closet like it's Crip walkin'
I'll silence these niggas if they keep talkin'
My bitch look down like I'm a pimp, you speak, she keep walkin'

All smiles when she see her son (Her son)

Wanna see my niggas on, it's still the same with me
Do it for the loyalty, not just a chain from me

Tell me
What you would do for any other motherfuckers than yourself?

These big homie rules, I give my lil' homie jewels
Some shit they can use
You give your lil' homie tools (Yeah)
And tell 'em go do some shit that you wouldn't do
You breakin' big homie rules
Big homie rules, it's a big homie move
'Cause this what big homies do
Never fold, lead by example (By example)
Never let nothin' come between the family
That's a big homie move
Big homie move
These are big homie rules
Big homie rules (Yeah)

Rule number one, believe in your dreams (Okay)
Always understand it's more than you, it's a team (What else?)
Rule number two, niggas' bitches off-limits (Yeah)
We don't do that in the family, no distractions while we winnin'
And rule three, it's kinda sensitive to me (What's that?)
This table full of plates, we make sure everybody eats
And communicate your issues, we can agree to disagree (Okay)
But talkin' family business that's out the family, that ain't G (For real)
Ain't no rats in here, so ain't no leaks (Ain't no bitches)
All my brothers' keeper, fuck these freaks (Fuck these bitches)
And rule number four, if you ever get fronted
Despite what you hearin', always pay their money
And rule five, this the only rule I don't really like (What up?)
Put a snake with a snake, you get a bite for a bite
And rule six, you must protect the brand with your life
I'd rather help you get a million than help you give a strike (True story)
And do you understand your publishing? Whether you rappin' or you hustlin'
Treat that like real estate and pay the government (Okay)
Family first, money second
You ain't takin' care of your family, I just can't respect it
These big homie rules, I give my lil' homie jewels
Some shit they can use
You give your lil' homie tools
And tell 'em go do some shit that you wouldn't do

'Cause this what big homies do
Never fold, lead by example
Never let nothin' come between the family
That's a big homie move
Big homie move

Big homie rules (Rules)

Ain't no jealousy in the crew (Why?), 'cause if I got it, then you got it
Lil' homie got a problem (What?), big homie solve it
Niggas talkin' boss talk, they never been a soldier (Soldier)
I just wanna cook up one more time to get some closure (Whip)
When it come to this beef shit, it is what it is
When a homie don't fuck with you, shit is what it is
They call it investment, I just believe in my dawg
Buss it down how you wanna, I just wanna see you ball
You ain't a boss, you're a mistake, nigga
How they put you in position when you fake, nigga? (Fake)
You lie to your team, you sell your niggas' dreams
When there's war, somehow you always in-between
The family and the opposition
Me, I like this nigga, but know my position
So it's fuck 'em and it's fuck 'em forever (Fuck 'em)
I take loyalty to a whole 'nother level
I get the information, pass it down (Down)
My homies know that's on my life, I always held 'em down
Last rule (Last rule)
If you gon' be a big homie (What?)
Treat your niggas with respect, not like a lil' homie

They will not be the last, no (Ayy, the album was done, I had to go back in on this shit)
'Cause this pain inside (See, I feel even more trapped)
It never seems to pass me, I said it never seems to pass me by
Yeah

Where'd we start off? How'd we go wrong?
Niggas risk it all to put a nigga name in his song
Niggas fighting over blocks that we don't even own
Leave the house to get a bag and never make it back home
Bulletproof truck, I'm full time rapping
I wasn't living like this when I was still trapping
Son seen me shed a tear, he like, ""Daddy, what happened?""
I'm like, ""Daddy aight, but Daddy don't know what's gon' happen""
Niggas rapping gangster lyrics and thinkin' it's cool
'Til you the suspect or victim they post on the news
So the dope that you selling the dope that you use
Y'all made poppin' pills cool, you niggas confused
I'm a true independent, you niggas should listen
Whether record label or not, I was investing my millions
I spent millions on my artists and did it consistently
If it ain't real boss talk, nigga, watch how you mention me
Real estate, got a check, twenty mil on that
Thirty in the bank, I'm fifty off, I'm still at that
I seen a hundred bricks, I had a hundred Dracos with a hundred shots
But 'til I see that hundred mil', I ain't really did nothing, nigga
I ain't impressed by a killer
I'm impressed by a hustler who's taking care of his mother and his brother
And his significant other
Put his niggas in position to show 'em he love 'em
'Cause this pain inside (Ayy, you know I just moved to LA, right?)
It never seems to pass me, I said it never seems to pass me by (So I had to ride down Crenshaw just to see it for myself, damn)
So I thank you, said I thank you (Just got a call back home too, said shit ain't lookin' good)
Said I thank you (Just life)
For makin' me a woman, oh

I just paid eight mil' to the IRS
I don't agree, but then again you can say I'm blessed
Late night, no sleep, you can say I'm stressed
Bruh called, say he fighting for his life, say less
Quarter mil' to the lawyer, straight cash, no check
Never lied to my niggas, I'ma stand on that
I done cried to my niggas (Cried to my niggas)
'Cause real brothers really love each other and nobody threats
I just went to Jay house, got hit with reality
I got a long way to go, for real, this shit baffling
Ninety mil' on a crib and he not an athlete
If I don't make it for my family, this shit gon' be a tragedy
I'm tryna live life and make sure they proud of me
I give no energy to critics or niggas who doubted me
I'm a black-owned business owner, entrepreneur
We all from the gutter, from the mud, from the sewer
Send a text to Meek (Yeah), told him move safe (Safe)
Send a text to Youngsta (Youngsta), I'm checking on your case
Send a text to Bagg (Bagg), boy, you're on your way (You're outta here)
Don't get caught up in these streets, you one hit away
I sat down with Bloc (What up?), told him, ""You're young, but you gotta take this shit serious"" (You gotta)
Life 'bout more than guns, hoes, and a lot of jewelry (For real)
I just hope that they hearin' me, I love these niggas dearly
They like, ""Gotti, you changed,"" yeah, I call it maturity
I gotta get to the bag, and these labels be fearing me
Five million in watches and no stones in the jewelry
FN on me, nigga, I'm securing security
I'm tryna get a hundred mil', fuck facing a jury
(Said I thank you)
See, niggas think all this lil' shit you doing cool (Said I thank you, for makin' me a)
'Til it's you versus the motherfuckin' federal government, nigga
Then what? (Said I thank you)
Then what you lil' niggas gon' do? (Said I thank you)

Had the FN with me, upped it on 'em daily
Baow baow baow baow baow, crazy

I hope none of these niggas come piss me off

Instead, they tried to bring a nigga down, federal court me
You my man, you can't take no stand, you can't make no statement
We been rockin' since the sixth grade, how you gon' betray me?

Damn, my own partner tried betray me
Thought you would be the one to save me
You played yourself when you played me
I got the key, yeah that's how they raised me

That's where all this shit started at, you namsayin
Stop sign shit, nahmean

Dice games, nigga lose it all

We were trappin' in and out the door, I remember
Miss Shirley's house breakin' down them things, I remember
I used to serve my partner momma, she's a crack fiend
Damn I remember

I ain't know no better my nigga, I apologize for that
Damn

I wanna apologize homie
I ain't realize homie
I had that hustler instinct
Everything we monetize, homie
Your little brother like my brother
It left him traumatized, homie
And you my nigga
You were down to do a homicide for me
It's that hood shit
We was on Woodcliff with them choppas
OCU and undercover narcos tryin' to stop us
Signed my first deal, focus did some good
Still, I put 100,000 worth of guns in the hood, I remember
They couldn't tell us shit nigga
We were ready to go to war with whoever
That's when we came up with Ridgecrest Afghanistans

Fiends lined up at the dope house
Used to have money, now you broke now
I used to write my raps in a dope house
Used to laugh at me, ain't a joke now

I caught my first charge on Shady Vista
Same street I shot my first pistol
Big G, damn I miss you nigga
Lil' Tweety, damn we miss you nigga
Look at me, we never envisioned this
If I crossed you on the way I never intended it
If I rob you I did it purposely
Still thinkin' 'bout niggas murkin' me
Dirty money we washed that shit in the laundromat
We were trappin' on the  bought a hundred MACs
You shot at us, you know we shot back
I'm from Ridgecrest, they say I don't know how to act
I apologize
Not for my actions, I was trappin'
I was tryin' to feed my family before I was rappin'
My first charge attempted murder and kidnapping
Now he sorry ask the victim what had happened

I had keys in the city before the keys to the city
So how the fuck the landlord think he gon' ban me
Fell out with real hittas from the hood, niggas couldn't ban me
'Cause my only plan b is death before I be a pussy
And throw this shit away before I let a nigga push me
Extort who? I wish you niggas knew
I ain't even fuckin' with you if you need to check to shoot
Ha, and take a chain from who?
Thirty million dollar, niggas just got something to prove
And if they mob they mob and that's what it was

If I could talk to god like a real nigga one on one, I'd tell him
Need my homeboys back, and a couple niggas that's jailin'
Couple niggas convicted felons
I like the church but I don't trust the reverend
Soul been absent in my presence
And am I wrong if I bring my weapon?
Yeah, I said my prayers, I got my blessings
I'm still stressing so I'm finessing
Ain't holding back, these my confessions
If I could talk to god like a real nigga one on one, I'd ask him
I see my career goin' to the next level but my mind goin' backwards
I can't shake the street shit, still on the beef shit
Every time I try to do the right thing niggas think I'm on some sweet shit
Then I had to get them choppers out again
I tried to retire Lord
Forgive me for my sins, once and once again
Somebody got to die, Lord
I'm like why Lord?
They think I'm blood, they think I'm vice Lord
I'm overthinking shit 'cause I'm paranoid like my homeboys
Is they right Lord? Is they foul Lord?
Real shit I'll take 'em out Lord
If I could talk to god one on one like a real nigga I'd say
Lord will you please keep me far away from the fake?

Lil Dora seen me with a strap, ask me, daddy, what is that?
Lil son asked me 'bout Cecil, told him he ain't coming back

Told 'em gangster baby, one thing about it is I ain't bulletproof
Never hire security 'cause I don't know what they gon' do or not
Wondering is they gon' shoot or not
Interview like how many niggas you done shot?
Old lady in the neighborhood said I'm the devil, she a damn liar
See me bustin' that fire, tryna protect the guys from the other side
Man I love these lil niggas like these my brothers
If any niggas come and touch 'em, I swear to god it'll crush 'em
I can't let that happen, 'fore I ever started rappin'
All that shit I be talking about, I was doin' that shit in the hood
With all the niggas I be talkin' 'bout
If I could talk to god like a real nigga, ask him please give me back Cecil
Please give me Big G and Poochy, then Pinot
Shit hurt Lord, I ain't over 'em
When the tears come it be pourin'
I know this rap shit my blessin' when I ain't in the hood shit be gettin' borin'
I'm so used to hustlin', I'm so used to thuggin', I don't know how to ignore it

I used to pray to god to get a million dollars and a Bentley truck
When I was dead broke I didn't have a dollar and I didn't give a fuck

Run it, my nigga, we so one hundred my nigga, it's only a few of us
Talkin' to god, just tryna decide if life really meant for the two of us

Watch me make it out, but then you pour hate on me
Shame on you
I was finna put the chain on you
Now I gotta put the aim on you
How your enemies the same, homie
Damn homie
Big homie shit (get the bricks and bust 'em down with you)
War shit a thousand rounds with you
I was wrappin' bricks and sending pounds with you
Now I'm on TV
Diamonds drippin', 
Deep inside you wanna be me
Federal 3 that shit on repeat
Reach for my chain,  (aye)
Feelin' like Yeezy so I need a cape
Talkin' bout Kim or talking to 
Black  on the side of the Wraith
When it come to the bag they know I don't play
I don't wanna go back
Sellin' no crack no more
I don't wanna go back (I don't wanna go)
Shootin' them Macs no more (brrt)
I don't wanna go back
But a nigga gon' make me

I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah

I know the hood gon' hate me, yeah (gon' make 'em hate me)

Ain't gon' lie
Sometimes I wish I could retire
Wish I didn't have to tote the fire
I wish my name wasn't always in the news
I can't go no where without the tools
If you go against me you gon' lose (lose)
Me and all the deals close every day
I barely made it outta school
Fuck credit, cash rules
Be like tell youngsta calm down
Put the guns down but I kinda feel 'em
You will never understand
You ain't from the hood, niggas tryin' to kill 'em
I tryin' to put my youngin' on the chart
They trying to trick my youngin' out of spite
You tryin' to cop a Benz off the lot
I'm tryin' to pull up in my own yacht
I got different dreams, different goals
We in different brackets, we got different hoes too
I don't  supposed to
Spread rumors, that's what hoes do
I was sick and tired, sick and tired of sellin' crack
If I have it my way I'm never goin' back
I hate a disloyal nigga and a rat
Fell in love with fast money and the strap
I don't wanna go back
Sellin' no crack no more

Shout out to Ty Ty, wassup nigga?
Emory, what it do?

Gotta pick 'em wisely
Gotta choose 'em carefully
Got niggas I know that weren't there for me
Got bitches I know that don't care for me
Could've went on tour with your favorite rapper and declined
Why? I'm tryna break CMG
So fuck that, I'm doin' mine
This CM9, CM8 supposed to be the last, the streets called me back
Say they miss the old Gotti, old Jeezy, old Boosie, that was real rap
In New York with 3 bangers
Did Jimmy Fallon with Meaghan Trainor
I guess the sets won't taint him
Guess the money can't change him
Decisions
Homie on probation
Took him up to Roc Nation
Let him meet Jay, told him be patient
Decisions, and lil homie really got it
Trying to tell him wait his turn
He ain't learn, lil homie caught a body

I feel the pressure, gotta follow up
Same time I can feel the feds
Gettin' closer, lockin' niggas up

Closer partners, they in prison
Never want to be the biggest
I just want to be the realest
I pay 6 figures a year for a hitter
Not 'cause he a goon, he my nigga (nigga, nigga)
He got the city divided
Bring it together, I tried it
Fuck them lil niggas, I tried it
Fuck them lil niggas, I tried it

You want a problem, well find it
I was too busy gettin' too many million
Like now the perfect timin'

Whatever come with it, I'm with it

But they'll never tell on they man, where them niggas at?
Who came through in that drop heavy before the deal? Me
Who bought himself out of his contract for half a mil? Me
Who kept the streets alive? Me, who put his niggas on? Me
Who rode with you right or wrong? Me, and repped the streets in every song
I know Young when Meech was free, talk to Meek before DC
I dodged a life sentence, niggas so can't shit discourage me
Get me a big ol bag of money if you trying to encourage me
They say it cost to be the boss well you say I paid the fee, nigga
I want the money nigga, yeah yeah (I do)
I want the power nigga, yeah yeah (- Do)

Hustle every hour nigga, yeah yeah (I do)
Do you see 'em doing it like this nigga no no?

Walk in the studio and enter the booth, talk to the microphone (mic check)
Tell 'em about your life and about the shit you be standin' on (I am)
How you put your niggas up (I did), how you fucked a thousand bitches (true)
But you never leaving home (I can't do it)
Bitches is bitches and family is family, for real
Rappin' was cool but dope what was payin' the bills
Friends they hate, they frenemies, they're not your enemies
They really do like you, they hate, just envious energy
You know the power of money, the power of fame
Bitches fuck on a nigga (for real), knowin' he lame
Damn to say it ain't personal for the shoes and the purses
It's like we said in the verse, the money ain't worth it, I can't do it

I want the money nigga, yeah yeah (I can do it)
I want the power nigga, yeah yeah (Fo' real)

Trap money, Neiman Marcus
250 in my pocket, I can buy a 'rari
I'm young, black and rich, I know I'm a target
If I put my hands up, they gon' shoot regardless
I just bought my sister that new Benz
This money turn your enemies to friends
Lil bitch tryna chop me for the pussy
So I would never fuck that hoe again
Audemaur, nig,  been a star, just bought another car
I been sellin' bricks, so white sour diesel out the jar
Cocaine had a nigga far, all my dogs know who they are
All my plugs gon' bring they pack, all my hoes gon' play they part
I'm the weather man, whatever man
Make it rain, make it snow, tell a hoe
I'ma change her
Like fuck her then tell her she gotta go

Besides, I'm tired of hearin' you hatin' on my lil perky bitch
And you way too excited 'bout this purse and shit
Head cool, pussy good but it ain't worth the shit
And ain't nothin' more annoyin' than a worse bitch
I want my purses back, my shoes when you leave
Bitches say I'm petty, hoe I even want the weave, I pay for it

I remember, see I remember like yesterday
Vividly, everythin' I went through

I remember long dice games
Been fucked up to steppin' up my ice game
Openin' at dark stages then the lights came
Went to Mexico, met a plug, then my life changed
And I was on vacation
Never was with waitin'
Always been impatient
Always 'bout the money
Never been with hatin'
Believe in loyalty, I help my niggas fight they cases
Don't believe in hope, I tell 'em hold they head
I tell 'em stack they bread
I tell 'em pipe it down
Before you get up in the feds, homie talkin' loud
Between you, I think you scared
'Cause if you really want the problem, he'll end up dead
And that's some real shit
I don't talk about niggas 'cause it's a waste of time
And when I talk to my young'ns, I tell 'em go and grind
And when I talk to the plug, I tell him double up
It's summer time, nigga tryna fuck the city up
I remember my first 9 like yesterday
Oil based, fucked up the kitchen lost an ounce of yay
Plug don't give a fuck, he like niggas still got to pay
My ounces 24 grams, not 28
That's the make up and every day I wake up
Grab my strap and talk to God
Make sure that I'm prayin'
And once I leave the house I may bump into a hater
And imma shoot is ass in the face, straight up
Don't believe in hoe problems so I leave these hoes
You need that time by yourself so you don't need these hoes
I'm worth 20 mil nigga, but a 100 to go
It was 375 a half, it's 650 an O
I been a partner with LA Reid and Jay Z
I'm still hangin' with niggas who coppin' half a keys
Still runnin' with niggas gettin' pounds
And still game to let your ass down, nigga, for real
I'm your rappers favorite rapper, I'm a trap hero
My whips KKK white and my guns negro
Black, white, white, black, I'm color blind
Nigga if your life matter, well nigga so does mine
Yeah this shell 9, streets call for it
It was just amount of time
And the phone sell the record, fuck I still fine
I'ma still hold my head high and still shine, yeah
I drop without a single
Man I used to throw 10 thousand singles
Used to have my dope in a can of Pringles
I sell every pack of paper
Can 30, I done need some net
Street nigga at heart and I'm oldschool
My niggas used to smoke loud, now they on dog food
It's no average life, nigga this average life
Partner killed a partner, go to the funeral, go the burial
Talk to his mama, this shit can get scary
I'm known none of this is gon' worry us
The cars material, money deteriorate
Bitches gon' vanish and still illuminate
I got plaques on the wall, niggas in the jailhouse
Got my advance check, bail my niggas out
Played my role nigga, fishin' them birds out
When you the kingkin, there ain't shit you can tell 'bout
Look around nigga, who you see
We in streets, nigga chance is learnin'
Gettin' Lamorghini, 200 k advance
And that ain't label money, that was mine nigga
'Cause l my young'ns got the same dream as mine nigga
You tryna be a young millionaire, me too
Move your family out the hood, me too
We jump coupes
And we ain't makin' WorldStar, we makin' news
So don't get this shit conferred, nigga
I remember when they tried to play me, huh
Notice how I said 'try'
On everythin' I love, that will never happen
I remember when I made my first milli'
I remember, on everythin' I love, I remember
I remember when they tried to count me out
So I count it up
On my mama, I remember
I also remember those that showed love
I'm forever grateful

I was a freshman and I was the freshest nigga in school, yeah yeah
I was trappin' in school, I was actin' a fool
I was a freshman and I was the freshest nigga in school, yeah yeah

Last nigga played with me in school, gave him the street blues
Nigga tried to jump me in school so I went and got my tools
Yeah, I was fresh in school
I been broke all my life, I got somethin' to prove hoe
I shot my teacher hoe bitch, I took recess hoe bitch
You better Google me and do your research hoe
I fucked plenty bitches under the bleachers hoe
I cheat on my bitch 'cause I don't need you hoe
When I skip school, Grandma whoop my ass
I give my lil' brother my last
Made the best out of what we had
Tried my best to make it last
It was hard on me and my brothers
I ain't never ever see my dad
All my life I had to struggle
That's why I talk shit and show my ass
I used to dream about a .9 when I had 4 in the spliff
When you fucked up, don't want no niggas around, is you and your bitch
Used to live in public housin', get free lunch at the school
Had to jump 'fore they came out, had them bring the strap to the school
I was trappin' in school, I was actin' a fool

It's 3am West Coast time nigga
We at Fat Burger
Hood nigga rich shit gourmet burgers
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

She pussy poppin, pocket watchin', they call her a thot
Bad credit, cash it out, fresh up off the lot
No back and forth, yippin', yappin', niggas gettin' shot
10 million, 20 acres, that's the new spot
Flooded out my crib and told my dealer you the illest
Renegotiate my contract, told my label I ain'tt feel it
Fell out with my partner, he mixed friendship with our business
Broke up with my bitch 'cause she was too much in her feelings
I may fuck her friend, fuck it, I may fuck her friend
Between me and you, I always wanted to fuck her friend
If I kill a hater, Lord you gotta forgive my sins
That's one fuck nigga you ain't gotta worry about again
I'm forever thuggin', I ain't never changed
In plain colors but forever bangin'
Blowin' money but I'm maintainin'
Blowin' money but I'm maintainin'
I got a gamblin' problem but money can't really solve it
Tryna help all the real niggas, hate to see a nigga starvin'
Hate to see nigga robbin' they own people, shit, that's loyal
Bitch tryna give me the pussy for a Birkin bag, I can't afford you
I grew listenin' to 2pac and that Biggie, Jay-Z and that Nas
No gimmick rappers, these niggas had bars
Back when record labels turnin' real niggas into stars
Sendin' niggas to Mars, nowadays the game done got hard
You get shot that make you hot
But where I'm from that make you start
Before I be a pussy, I'd rather rapper had the balls
I throw me some guns, get myself a charge
Never see me do that, I came too far to look back
I did too much to get help, 20 mil in one year
100 grand in one night, 50k on one flight
I've been trappin' my whole life
Ain't no secret, I be thuggin', ain't no secret, I be hustlin'
Pickin' loyalty over money, money orders to my homies
Groupie bitches be all on me, leave your phones at the door
You won't put me on no blog, once I fuck, you gotta go
3am ain't nothin' open but IHOP
And a bitch legs, and my trap spot
I said 3am, I'm trappin' at the IHOP
And I'm connected to the plug like a hotspot
Like WiFi
(Producer/hype man)
Nah, nah keep going

I'm a grower, we don't do droughts
(Alright 10 more bars)
Birds in the sky, we call them iClouds
You know the birds fly down south
I took your bitch to eat at Mr. Chow's
(Shoot off)
I met the plug at Benihanahs

On hibachi grills, eatin' rice and talkin' numbers

I don't do no middle men and I don't trust no runners

I got some bitches I fuck time to time, don't love em at all

Leave the house without the strap, that's something I can't do
Nah, I just can't do it

I just can't be broke
You gotta have type of hustle 'bout yourself, fuck my P.O
I'm sippin' plenty lean and smokin' propane, that's that good smoke
(That's that good gas, nigga, what you is?)
Just a hood nigga with money
I'm in a foreign whip riding dirty, it got bogus tags on it
College bitch with me can't suck dick, really all she do is gag on it
Fucked around and got a ratchet bitch pregnant, I hit her raw man
Fresh out the bando, eighty thou, it can't fit in these Balmains
(Can't fit in my jeans)
C-Bo told me stack it up and go hard on these niggas and hating hoes
When you in the streets you can't leave that strap, that's a part of your wardrobe
And I rock expensive attire
After she fuck she fired
These hoes be slicker than niggas
Can't love 'em, these bitches be liars
I be around murderers (What they do?)
They shooting like Manu (Ginobli)
Just keep your mouth close homie, snitching?
That's something you can't do (don't break the code)

I am the king, ain't got to hate

I watched his interviews, don't like his energy
Only D'usse, not the Hennessy
Ooh, pulled up in a half a million dollar car like fuck these niggas
When you twenty million dollars up, you don't be studying niggas

When them young niggas hungry they’ll eat you, they creatures
Went and iced out me a few pieces off shows and features
Shawty ass fat, long hair, she got features
Had to cut 'em off, had to stop fucking with 'em, they were leeches

Hottest nigga where I’m from

Couple labels, they done called for me
Then Gotti done called for me (CMG)
Then I turned up at birthday bash
All my fans was going crazy for me
Plenty guns, face on the news
Then I thought shit was going bad for me
They were ballin’, I was in the bleachers watching
Came up on my own, how you gonna knock me?
Now I’m hot, on the stove, bricks I'm poppin'
Meanwhile, yeah your favorite rapper floppin'
Diamonds dancing, Chris Breezy
Lay up, yeah your bitch was easy
She say I fuck better on them tabs
Popped one, and left that pussy leaking
Fucked her like I was still squeaking
White emoji what she tweeted

Ho lied like she pregnant
To tell the truth she was messy

I ain't gon' lie, I hit her a couple times
I really was thirsty though
She was just one of them bitches you hit four in the morning
Like come to the door
Crust in her eyes while she drive, she coming straight to me
She put that rachet pussy head on a nigga
I'm going straight to sleep
I tried to tell her fold it, she unfolded
I can't have fucking with you on my name
We started off cool and then the shit changed
I guess the good dick done fucked up her brain
Hold up, hold up, lil bitch you tripping out
Got a bitch at the house, you not my spouse
Without a doubt, I stopped fucking with you
Had to cut you off, like scissors will do
Ain't gon' lie, your lil action was clutch

You're a reflection of me, you're a reflection of me
You're a reflection of me shawty
It took a while for me to understand you the one for me
You know how that shit goes
Now they using us for example when they post relationship goals
I be sacking the dope, you do it too
When I blew the money you blew it too
I be tripping when you try to talk like me
Swear you run this shit, like a boss like me
You be talking and kicking shit with my partners
Me and you both rock Balenciagas
We  head of the game like we the Carters
When we talking 'bout money we count a lot of it
When she hear about niggas in the streets hating
She be like fuck them niggas bae
I never trusted them niggas bae
I'll load up and bust at them niggas bae
I swear she so gangster, she G, a reflection of me
Shawty something to keep
She like riding luxury, peep all the fuckery
Shawty a female version of me

I count the money, you count it too
'Cause you a reflection of me shawty

You a reflection of me shawty
When it's time to ride you loading up
'Cause you a reflection of me shawty

Three sisters,  she the youngest
She ain't never broke a promise (not once)
Last nigga left her, lucky me
Yeah he gotta be the dumbest
You're a reflection of me
If a nigga say hi you don't speak
You don't argue about niggas and bitches (at all)
Just talk about how we going to eat (we is)
The Bentley truck droppin', it's sweet
I want red, I think she want pink
Her lil friends on the low tryna fuck on me
She ain't tripping 'cause she know what's up with me
Ain't no sneaky shit, we got them levels

I don't where to begin, fuck it I'm going straight in
I guess you mad because I choose the beats over the streets
Shit ain't the same homie, thought you was my main homie
You put dirt on my name homie, got with niggas and changed on me
I keep that thang on me, better stay in your lane homie
Shit been going crazy since I started buzzin
I ain't expect this shit from my cousin, it's like
When I was at the bottom you was going hard to me
Now I'm on top and you don't even talk to me
I started getting shows for 2500 a piece
And choppin it up, making sure all of us eat
You don't want the best for me, you rather see me in jail or decease
You went that way cuz you wanted to, I fuck with you fuck nigga tell the truth
You pose to be right here with BGE, you pose to be with me ridin in the coupe
Niggas that I slicked? How?
On social sites talking foul
Saying how they gon do this and that
Saying shit they ain't bout
Saying how I'm unloyal, saying how I ain't keep it real
I'm the one to put you in position to make money, how I ain't keep it real?
Saying how they made money, saying how they don't fuck with him
Shit nigga, if it's that easy, then let me see you make another one
Fronted me, I curved em, I was leaking I was hurtin'
Now I'm foreign whips swerving, coming thru the Jackson no Curtis
Niggas ain't trustworthy, on the real steal from they friends
A bitch fucked me over, broke my heart and I told myself never again
See, a nigga like me done been through shit and gon' go through shit
It's just how you gon' overcome that shit
See, I emerged from the mud, from the struggle
From the bottom for real
I put my heart and my soul into this shit here
I done dreamed and dreamed and wished and prayed
I get to the position I'm in today
See I done fucked over and been fucked over
It's bad, what's up with you my nigga
It's sad, it's coming from you my nigga
You rooting for niggas that won't even give you a dime
I put in my effort and time to grind and shine
Niggas form my hood trippin'
But I'm still walking home, Tennessee with me
Niggas really in they feelings
Cuz I fuck with Gotti and big homie fuck with me
But it's still Bread Gang and CMG
But it's still Bread Gang and CMG
I don't know where a nigga begin
It's like the richer I get I'm losing my friends
You gotta watch these hoes, they some liars and then
Lay up with you, pretend and then fuck your friend

I deserve a gold medal, Olympics
The way I do my thing in the kitchen
Just broke a world record, Guinness
Went to culinary arts but you don’t hear me
Got the work ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the purp ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got the stick ridin’ ‘round in a hemi
Got your bitch ridin’ ‘round in a hemi

I just pulled up at Privé in that Hellcat
Just shitted on these niggas, do you smell that?
When you violate parole, where the cell at?
Lil homie just pissed thirty, yeah you feel that
A hood nigga with millions, they be fearing that
You hating is a disease, ain’t no curing that
When it’s war no explanations, I ain’t hearing that
I make all my niggas bonds, I’m insuring that
I been up for four days, forty rounds with four Ks
Some my niggas on cocaine, some my niggas on codeine
I just bought a Stingray for my lil young bitch
She took a pistol charge for me on some dumb shit
I deserve a gold medal, Olympics

Got your bitch ridin’ ‘round in a hemi

Two Cuban links and a Rollie, that’s my double trophies
Made the work disappear, call that hocus pocus
The streets keep on calling me, tryna keep my focus
Got bread on me, got lead on me, won’t catch me loafing
I drunk a four of some Hi-Tech
You might catch me dozing
I’m kicking shit in the projects
You might catch me posted
Riding ‘round with the stick in the Audi
Couple gangster niggas with me, they ‘bout it
Trifling bitch eat the dick like candy
I’m a dog, I’m a savage, Randy
I deserve a million dollars, I’ve been trill, no EMT
I’m the shit, now I get followed, paparazzi, TMZ
Ho your nigga sound like Stevie, man that boy ain’t seeing me
I do my thing in the streets, off of beats I’m selling P’s

Riding shotgun in that Rari with Youngsta
Still got thirties on the Chevy ‘cause I’m country
I’m addicted to the jewelry, ask the jeweler
I’m a rich dope boy, don’t know nobody cooler
My lil young bitch don’t know shit but I’ma school her
Told her take them Jordans off and put these Loubs on
This a Chanel bag, you deserve that
You got Chanel swag, you got Michelle swag
I feel like Obama, push a button and get Osama
Watch when I drop this CM9 I’ma kill the summer
Fucking up the streets always
I was getting it out the hallway
Selling fifty packs in 
Had to stack it up the small way

The teacher asked me what I wanted to be
I stood in front of the whole class and I told her I wanted to be a gangsta

Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty (It’s my city nigga)
And you don’t have to travel to another world
Cause there’s a war zone in my city (It’s a war zone out here)
Oh Memphis, oh Tennessee
No other place will be home for me (Ever)
All the people, all the struggle
In a world full of fakes, my city make me a real hustler
(True hustler)

First Three Six break up, and every day I wake up
A nigga got a problem with me
I got a hundred clips, a hundred guns, a hood full of killers
And I dare something could happen to me
See my city at a different state, its no honor
We used to have to make it through the year now it's the summer
And everybody mob somthin’, everybody rob somethin’
Everybody scrap and everybody shot somethin’
Young niggas like ISIS
Killin’ like they got a license
Life used to be priceless now it’s worthless
Niggas gone on missions ain’t even worth it
Homie chill (chill)
Lil homie chill (chill)
Lil homie don’t respect the big homies no more
Drakos and choppers, no more handguns no more
Four deep, four hundred shots, everybody under 16
I remember I was getting’ bricks for the 16
The city changed nigga
Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty
And you don’t have to travel to another world
Cause there’s a war zone in my city
Oh Memphis, oh Tennessee
No other place will be home for me
All the people, all the struggle
In a world full of fakes my city make me a real hustler

You know it’s rules and regulations when you king of the city
And niggas comin’ for the throne, some niggas don’t make it home
Ain’t talkin’ that rap shit, I’m speaking about real beef
Where big homies can get wet and niggas can’t get sleep
Put a 10 on a nigga, fuck that put a 50
Make his friend do the nigga, this Memphis, Ten, nigga
Home of the poverty, home of the robberies
I be goin’ through some real shit like nigga don’t you bother me
It’s goin’ down in the DM
Nah nigga it’s goin’ down when I see him
Biggest record of my career, I’m becomin’ a star
And I’m shootin’ an AR out the car
Just look at your favorite rapper
Just be patient, he gon’ fuck up, he a Memphis nigga
Maybe I will, maybe I won’t, thuggin’ in a nigga
Money don’t change that, fame can’t change that
I’ve done shit to niggas in the streets I can’t take back
So every second of my life I got a gun and I hate that
But this Memphis, if you get caught without you gon’ regret that
So fuck it
Every day somebody’s killed in these streets
Whether innocent or guilty
And you don’t have to travel to a foreign land
Cause there’s a war zone in my city

Will my niggas try to betray me cause I know they vultures

Will my baby mama finally quit texting my phone
Kiss my daughter and my son tell em I'm coming home
Tell my niggas put the pistols down I'm in the zone

This that shit they been waiting for forever long

I had to watch his mama cry and tell her let's be strong
Ima hold him down he won't do all that time alone
What if I wasn't a rapper the streets would get annoyed
Cause don't nobody tell it how I tell it and you know it
What if they say I changed cause I went outside the box
What's good I kept my plug number so I can get some blocks

When you get a check like this that'll put a smile on your face
When you got a wrist like this that'll put a frown on they face
When you ball hard like me they gonna call a foul on the play
Shit that they smoking too quiet so I got the loud on the way
Shit that I'm rocking in the club, boy I spent a bag on a swag
Shit that I'm drinking in the club, that was 10 thousand a case
If you see a hater with a frown on 'em
Turn it upside down on 'em
Hashtag pound put the pound on 'em
He a pussy it's going down on 'em
100 round drum in the case I'll put a child in his place
Walk around with 100k and won't give your bitch the time of the day
Put a smile on your face hater
Put a smile on your face hater
What you mad at me for? dab to the paper
Put a smile on your face bitch
Put a smile on your face bitch

Hi hater
Popping bottles standing on tables
Sparkles in the air celebration
We just tryna dab to the paper, dab to the paper
Smile on my bitches, smile on my peers
Smile on my face walking in the crib
Frowns on my haters when they see the crib you should see they face when they see the whip
I can put a smile on your face that's all jokes to the side
And nigga put a frown on your face some shit you just can't hide
Let me put my hand on your waist
Pull your hair and hit it from behind
I bet that put a smile on your face
Bet that put a smile on your face
Heard you got a job that you hate
Heard you got some bills that's late
Heard you got a nigga you can't shake
Heard you got a friend that's fake
Girl you need a thug in your life
Girl I need a plug in my life
I never had love in my life
I was busy selling drugs all my life
Put a smile on your face hater
Put a smile on your face hater

Yeah
Bills due on the kitchen table
Mama walked past em cause she ain't able
Watching mama's family sister tryna watch cartoons muthafucka came through and clipped the cable
Get a job that's the usual
Mama had a job that ain't do enough
Mama hired me I'm sacking groceries up
90 days later I was posting up
Quarter pound of weed 250 strong
Staying out late bringing profit home
It's me and Big G tryna stack it up
Shit ain't been the same since my nigga gone
I looked up to niggas like Hookshot
Niggas like Lil Pat and Woo Woo
I was on the block as a young boy
Watching them hustle it was like school

I hustled with the greats, ate with the vultures and the snakes
My days turned to nights my nights turned to days
Streets got me paid
And I know Ima pay the price for it

One day Ima pay the price for it

First time I seen 100 grand
First time I seen 1 mill

Homeboys start acting different
Shit changed I ain't even tripping
Same nigga used to ride for em one time I was on the front line for em
I was a hitta for a dopeboy
Play crazy yeah you know boy
Im in the hood with the doors up
Nigga I ain't never froze up
Bad bitches chose up
They like me or the lifestyle

Never got indicted that's my blessing

I ain't savin' no hoes, it ain't Sunday

I blew a 10 at the mall and a 10 at Kamal's
And a 20 at Magic last Monday

With some niggas who ain't done it
That's 45 keys on a calibrated scale, bitch countin' on her stomach
If you checkin' the math, countin' on your fingers to add
We don't count extras when it's like Tetris
Yuugh, let me dummy down my lecture

My Rollies got missin' numbers

If you screenshottin', you the police, 10 likes, you want OD
Follow shawty then unfollow then follow back, that's so me
She like, ""I killed him, bitch, I killed him, really killed him""
Bitch, you wouldn't look like that if you undid all them filters
(And angles)
I seen your girl post her BM
So I hit her in her DM
All eyes, yeah I see 'em
Yeah, that's your man? I'd hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)

Your dick ain't good enough to be stylin' on me
You's a bitch ass nigga to keep on wildin' on me
Hit my side nigga, ""Quick, fast! Pull up in that quick, fast!""
I ain't talkin' pancakes, but he flip a brick fast
A bunch of bad bitches, ain't doin' the dab, bitches
Dobbie and some bangs, couple Cs on their bag, bitches
Fuck you mean? Fuck your little memes
Even Queen Bey had to tell 'em I'm the queen
Check the D, blessed indeed
The executive producer, bitch, rest in peace
Then he put his hands in my pants, felt them thick lips, and got wood
He said, ""Kylie, wuss good?"" I said, ""Miley, wuss good?""
I said, ""Could you pay my bills, like O'Reilly? Wuss good?""
I just sit back and observe, all these niggas that I done curved
If it go down in your DM, then baby boy, you lucky
Cause 99.9%, of these fuckboys can't fuck me
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go... down)

Yo, I seen your man post a quote, and a pic in bed
So I hit him in the DM, like, ""Hey bighead
'Member when I was your woman crush?"", He said, ""Yeah""
Told him that I'm headed home, he could meet me there
Try to beat me there, let me be clear
Is you eatin' ass too? Nigga, pinky swear
I'm just lookin' for a dude, that could eat the twat
Do he make more dough, than the pizza shop?
Do he dress every day, like it's Easter Sunday?
Can he give me more head, than Peggy Bundy?
Man, fuck I look like turnin' down some dome?
Man that's sorta like a dog turnin' down some bone
Nigga know that I'm a 10, that's Celine on my lens
I don't need another friend, it's just me and my Ms
I said, ""What you like about me?"" He said, ""That your ass fat""
He said, ""Would I let him eat this ice cream out my ass crack?""
He said that it's abstract, he said, ""Yo, yo ass crack!""
I told him ""I'm never frontin',"" then I threw that ass back
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the DM (it go down)
It go down in the DM (it go down, it go... down)

I tell her...
Snapchat me that pussy (mood)
Snapchat me that pussy if it's...cool
Snapchat me that pussy (mood)
Snapchat me that pussy if it's...cool
I seen your girl post her BM
So I hit her in her DM

Yea I'm coming back at em
I ain't letting up off these niggas
Fa what?
Verse:
This the squeal to this shit
Yea that White Friday
Got dropped by the industry
But the streets hired me
Yea the streets hired me
Yea the plug signed me
5 bricks for my advance
Breaking bread with my lil mans
In the kitchen with that pot and with that work I'm too ad  vanced, man
Free Tha Guys Homie
I'm fighting to bring the guys home (Iam)
Fuck the judge
Money ordered
Head bowed, praying for ya
Dialogue:
Ay if you find another nigga like me point em out
I wanna fuck wit him you know what i'm saying
I need that nigga on my team homie (Free Tha Guys)
? See this niggas can't fuck with me cause they ain't fit to be fucked wit ?
Verse:
I'm always in the kitchen
My brother went to prison
Hate I couldn't finish college
Had every point intended
Niggas hating I sense it
I can feel the tension
I can see em muggin
But they don't want the issue
Fuck security bitch I start bussin, (Blah)
Fuck security bitch I start bussin
Niggas paying for protection
Guess they gettin extorted
I don't understand they logic
I just can't support it
Mind your business Gotti (Iam)
I just can't ignore it
I'm just speaking out my mind
And they record it
When I see fuck shit in the game

And I do real beef I don't rap beef that's why I avoid it

We got extendos on them blammers, (100 shots in that AK)
Free lil homie from Alabama, (Free lil homie free lil homie)
Just bought a mansion in Atlanta, ( 2 Million dollars for my homie)
Play wit them keys like a piano
It ain't no business we can't handle, (It ain't no issue we don't handle)
Been through alot of shit with the same clique of niggas
You don't see him round then the nigga wasn't wit us, (Fuck It)
Or he was wit us till he did some foul shit
Look this lawyer ass nigga, put him on the bench
Take him out the game
Taking back his chain
How you go against the boss
When he put you in the game
Stupid ass...
Dialogue:
I don't get it man
It be some stupid ass niggas
Hey

And this might be the last one I do so...understand this a street nigga collectors item homes

And don't nobody talk that shit like you, Gotti
Ayy, we got about three minutes on this one
Aight
We gotta give 'em that shootoff shit
Aight
Off the top
Aight
Three minutes
Let's go

This that CM8, nigga, fuck a tape, this a classic
This that fresh up off the digi scale to the plastic
This that if you go against the hood, shit get drastic
This that in the kitchen flippin' dope like a gymnastic
This what they been waitin' on
Pulled up in that Lamb', nigga, this what they been hatin' on
Plus I put my mans on
I'm the man, I, I'm the man
I made myself a million and started off with three grams
That's an 8 ball, I ain't talkin' 8 ball
The hood I'm livin' legend, like I'm 8Ball
I seen straight hoes turn to killers
'Cause you got more money don't make you realer
I ain't never talkin' no loss and I ain't talkin' down on my dawgs
(Nah, nah, keep goin')
And I ain't goin' to war 'bout no broad unless it's my mama, nigga
I'm a rich crip, , I'm Osama, nigga
(Ha, you heard this shit, Leo?)
(I said )
, nigga
I need a women like the first lady
So she she can have fourth baby
So I can buy my fifth crib
And get that bitch a whole meal
I can change the floor when I wanna or how I wanna
Do what I wanna, when I wanna
I've been sellin' legal, any legal, Marijuana, I'm a hustler, ain't it
Turn his ass into an organ donor
Run his ass , you barred
Bitch hurt your heart, you're scared
I understand, it's hard
Sike, fuck a bitch and fuck everything about the bitch and fuck her nigga too
And fuck what you're goin' through and what you've been through and who you came to
I've been drinkin' Hennessy thinkin' 'bout the  with 'em
'Til I catch up with 'em and put the TEC to 'em
'Til I catch up with your partners 'cause I'm next to 'em
Then I write him off the list, put an ""X"" to 'em
(Then go back to CM1, go off)
This that OG cocaine music shit, that shootoff
Back when I was havin' shootouts right in front of  house
Back when me and Grip was breakin' half of bricks down in Big G's house
Back when me and Dee was skippin' school and takin' hoes to eat out
Back when I got my first crib, we turnt that bitch into a fuck house
Then we start robbin' then we turnt that to the duck out
You can ask my mama, nigga,  bust out
Fucked up so many rooms that she told me to get the fuck out
So I got the fuck out, ran my money the fuck up
Convinced my plug to trust us, then I fucked his sack up
This flow too slow, so I gotta speed it up
Bad bitch, beat it up
Never ever eat it up
I'ma leave her boyfriend for that
Real nigga, frontline
On sight, I'm fine
True hustler bloodline, gotta love that

Ups Downs Ups Downs Ups
This might be the last one
Dope Boy forever

Put me in the trap of fame (I'm the trap of fame, in the trap of fame)
Yeah they'd say the trap will change (Say the trap will change, say the trap will change)
Only to the cocaina
And now I'll put it all in my name
Cause I never ever gave a blackout to the game
This the trap of fame

This the trap of fame

And trapping will never be the same
Never be the same

I'm the type of millionaire
I'm the type of real nigga
If you could have a bed full of fifties
Right there, my ill figure
Ran off, ran off on the plug
Damn right, I'm an ill nigga
I ain't never had a problem shooting that pistol
Ever since I was a lil' nigga
This the trap of fame
Sold a lil' dope but the trap was lame
Word is your word and your name your name
Fuck up your brain and black out of the game
Got a little money but you sold your soul
Now its came down 
Bring it with the hood every time I scope
Hundred semi full of bricks and a thousand boats
That the trap of fame
That the Heisman trophy
I'm still from the game
Touchdown with the 
Field goal, field goal, fuck that, I'm going for the extra point

MVP, nigga what I want

I use to sell an O for the six fifty work
In a two door white Sedan dirt
Black top convertible
Play with me, I'll murder you
How you the plug in the town nigga?
Nobody ever heard of you
Type of nigga to pull up in 
And never heard another word from you
Kidnap his ass (Ransom, Ransom)
Clean face but I'm a jack boy
Sell him two bricks for the forty flat
 to his house, get it right back
Will you tell me what happened to him?
I fuck with you, get it right back
Cut throat city, I'm from North Mem and we let em work it out cause he was boys with me pussy
This the trap of fame
I really love the game and everything come with it
I'll be a number one draft pick
If you compare the streets to an athlete
Ball ball ball hard, boy I got money like I'm an athlete
And they gonna have a party in advance with the best of the hustles on the day they retire me

Put me in the trap of fame (I'm the trap of fame, in the trap of fame)

I'm like a bird myself nigga wrap me up and move me
I got a stamp in the middle the whole hood approve me
But you can't break me down (down) you gotta sell me whole (whole)
Its a drought on real niggas you already know
I'm that ether nigga that fish scale
You that oil base homie you don't cook well
I'm Yo Gotti the king and i got that young cash
New money in a mufuckin dufflebag
Old hundreds in a sour creme ruffles bag
Dope money bitch i keep a couple hundred stashed
Chorus x2

Cocaina heavily cooking dope excessively
Heavy risk activity my god given ability
Hid the bricks in the 6 wait 'til they get low to ???
Shawty snort a lotta powder let her snort it off the bricks
Gucci mane the dope boy point me where the jays at
Heres a 50 slab watch my'74 to payday
Shawty want some hardball baby want some powder
I'm so high I see stone mountain
Gucci got the birds I ain't talking bout the Falcons
Gucci slanging birds also known as a dragon
Hundred pounds of mid-grade stash that in my magnum
Roll it to the country then them country boys I tax them
Gucci mane bastard cook that dope faster
Make that dope stretch like a 80 inch plasma
Coke stank dope stank smoking on my airplane
80 in the air mane bricks over here mane
Chorus x2

Yeah, I never thought I would be riding dirty on I-10 just re-up and flip again
Rent a car from enterprise license proof of insurance
Speed limit 65 so I'm going 62
Both hands on the steering wheel driving like a old lady do
Crackers pull me over they ain't got shit gotta let me dip
Purple haze is all I smoke but she couldn't make it on this trip
Usually keep a pistol too one in the chamber clip full
Not today on I-10 its nothing but me and Redbull
Collared shirt brown slacks looking like a business man
Bible on the passenger side yeah I'm a christian man
Yeah I pray to god let me get these bricks back lord
Please don't let these crackers try to search this lil ol' Honda accord
Shit I'm wide awake, I ain't sleepy so I ain't gon swerve
Told you I like to trap it when it rain I call em Thunderbirds
Im the only one touch the work so I know its uncut

When the sun rise I got a lot of fiends
I'm sellin' 20 rocks the same size as lima beans (two for one)
You want to purchase one get the second half off
But this ain't dealers nigga I'ma blow your ass off
If I ain't in my Benz you see me in a rental
I'm bout to rap with a 9 piece chicken dinner
You know they goin' fast better get with me nigga
45 for the home team rest of you 250 nigga
A thousand grams of white that'll bring me 20 stacks

While you fantasize and dreamin' bout a hundred stacks
I'm coast to coast and across the border tryna get a sack
My main bitch she a soldier and she ride with me
The people scooped her tried to turn her to an eye witness
But I ain't worried about it cause she ain't seen shit
My lawyer say I'm good but I don't trust him they don't mean shit

Yeah she a freak with it
Shawty so unique with it
Skeet it in her mouth
And she talkin' 'bout you keepin' it
Head game foreal, left a nigga with the chill
Fix her nails, pay her bill
Bo, why don't you these hoes what it is!
You motherfuckers knows the score
Plenty hoes, plenty dro
And you already know what it is!

Bend it over, touch your toes

Haha, you know who it is!
I'm a fool, I've accepted this
Diamond in my necklaces
Jacqueline High

Hagon leave the haters on the side line heckling
My pimpin is immaculate
Hard like Calculus, and after this'
Over you gonna see what the fuck I mean
See me in your Beamer, see me on the big screen
I sell a bitch a big drink cause that means bread
She super bad plus I know that she's in
I'm done dictating songs, cause that means bad
Try'na get that pop belly, cause that means it
If you attending to coward shit, that means scared
I'm a hustla first and foremost, and that means it
IT'S BOHAGON AND YO GOTTI!

I'm from the North Pole, they call me Young Santa
I'm movin' bricks from Memphis clean to Atlanta
And everythang in between
Them niggas down in Cashville payin' 900 for a pound of green
When the sun rise I got a lot of fiends
I'm sellin' 20 rocks the same size as lima beans (two for one)
You want to purchase one get the second half off
But this ain't dealers nigga I'ma blow your ass off
If I ain't in my Benz you see me in a rental
I'm bout to rap with a 9 piece chicken dinner
You know they goin' fast better get with me nigga
45 for the home team rest of you 250 nigga
A thousand grams of white that'll bring me 20 stacks
If it ain't comin' in a wrapper I'ma ship it back
Cause niggas steppin' on the shit and recompressin' it

Lit up like a chandelier diamonds shinin' everywhere
And not to mention I'm a cash money millionaire
While you fantasize and dreamin' bout a hundred stacks
I'm coast to coast and across the border tryna get a sack
My main bitch she a soldier and she ride with me
The people scooped her tried to turn her to an eye witness
But I ain't worried about it cause she ain't seen shit
My lawyer say I'm good but I don't trust him they don't mean shit
They say you kill a nigga that shit be on your conscience
They say I'm young and having money so I'm money laundering

Fully loaded most bird punk that'll bang ya
Full-time thug and I'm a full-time gangsta

I'm full-time switchin lanes, rims spinnin, swirvin
Full-time on the grind in the North servin
Keisha and Tameka and Shanika, Marilyn
Were full-time freaks but were part time virgins
You were so blind you couldn't read between the lines
See ya baby momma slash right was part time mine and
I didn't really care about a part time hair
Or a part time feelins and chillen wit y'all chillin
I'm a full-time pimp you a part time spouse
I just burn her brains, get them thangs, throw em' in her house
I was out the frame, movin cane, runnin in and out
When them people came, know the game, shut ya fuckin mouth


You a part time soldier runnin in the battlefield
Talkin loud, sayin nothin, that's how you got ya homies killed
Full grown man wit a part time plan
So you walkin round, head down, lookin for a hand
I'm a part time rapper, full-time trapper
Copped my own bricks and shit and own my own Master's
Done the shit myself so I can get it done faster
Promised to myself that I wasn't fuckin wit you actors
Full-time boss you a part time C.E.O. from never never land
Peter Pan you's a middle man yea
Yo Gotti got the money and the power
You part time snitch and you a full-time coward

This ya boy Yo Gotti
Street Tunes Productions
We gon' ask everybody to stand up on this one
D Boys, this a gangsta party
Bun B, Eightball and this ya boy Yo Gotti

All my hot girls bop for me
Go 'head and drop for me
D Boys rock with me
Come buy the bar with me
Dime pieces smile for me
And all my gangsta niggas wild for me
Throughout the crowd with me

This for them big, thick fine girls, diamond-studded belly ring
Niggas who be flippin' that work, screamin' money ain't no thing
Car clean, mouth full of gold with the princess cut rocks in it
Back pockets hangin' low because I got a Glock in it
Straight out of that Memphis, Tenn Orangemound for y'all niggas don't know
Come flip with a pimp, let me show ya how to nuke that swing like I was Nino
Premro, Fat Boy, Eightball whatever y'all niggas wanna call me
Call me for a hot sixteen I'mma shine in the booth like a brand new bling
But I don't sing I bust them flows that go so tight with the track
Bitches get freaky niggas get crunk and don't know how to act
I got the sack roll something, pop that 'gnac and po' it
Ya fine bitches pop that puss like ya know it

I was movin' 'caine just doin' my thang
Down here in Memphis where we off the chain
Now, turn the top on my sixty-seven class then I'm switchin' lanes
I done served a fiend, sipped the lean, twenty-four inches don't cloud my screen
Roll candy paint, blowin' purple dank, they claim grip grain but I know they ain't
I'm posted in the club, we can get it poppin'
Ya violate my gangsta partner then it's bodies droppin'
I just come to party, get at shorty head
Do my thang, spit some game you know how Gotti play it
I'm like all these hoes gon' get it man
One of these hoes gon' get it man
From the 'Mound to the west to the north to the south
Yo Gotti gon' represent it man
No fitted man just a head band, Polo shirt and some Birdmans
Still thugged out and it ain't no secret
I got my paper out the drug zones
I got my paper out the gutter man
Sellin' bud man with my brother man
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days
You'd see why Gotti still love the game
My wrist, my neck, my ear, my hand, my mouth look like a light show
Yo bitch, my bitch, his bitch, her bitch just hit the flo' and get it low

This for all my street niggas and bitches
From M Town to H-Town
Free Pimp C, shit

Here we come, we keepin' it trill
Ain't no need to ask if you see
Ain't nobody gon' keep it triller than me
Myself and I that's Bun B
I'm a G, I'm a boss, I grip grain and I sip lean
I'm ball all out with the biggest G's and spit and throw the sixteen
When it come down to the south you know that I'm holdin' the key
I be in the Caddy rollin' on women damn near older than me
Them screens six inches or better, the stitches in the leather
If the trunk is popped it'll show in neon get it together
Cuz when I pull up at the valet man
Eyes is wide and them jaws is droppin'
Steppin' out the freshest clothes, brightest ice man the show is stoppin'
People start oohin' me eyein' soon as they see us
Women wanna be with us and fellas they wanna be us
We the G's and don't try to fight it, got dro and we fixin' light it
Laid back and that thang up on us we startin' to get excited

Cuz we havin' a gangsta party man everyone's invited

This mixtape here
It's strictly for the fans (yogottimusic.com)
Trust me!
I want my album to drop more than you
Call the fucking label and ask them what happening
Dear world, fuck it
Truly yours!
King
Verse 1:
I'm on my grown man flow band up flow
Nigga I just brought a phantom off the showroom floor
See these niggas sub-tweeting, but his fans don't know
He's a pussy and I expose this nigga I said a ho
In the streets niggas look up to Gotti and I understand why
Ain't on this slick shit nigga, I see eye to eye
Running around, talking down, playing games, nigga die
Young niggas in the clip, black nines, nothing but fire!
(ay let the beat sing to em)
Look, my brother back in jail, my songs leaking out
Little rappers playing with me
I'm trying to stop from clicking out
Did a show in Alabama, guess my strap was sticking out
Security to try the arrest nigga, but instead they kicked me out
I've been going through a lot of shit, fucking with this model bitch
Baby momma left a nigga and now it hard to see the kids
Record label can't get it right, they pushed the date back
Ross hit a nigga up try to put me on Maybach
Tip hit a nigga up trying to give me Grand Hustle
All these niggas are my niggas and I respect the hustlers
Some of these niggas like my brothers
They've been real since day one
Realest nigga in it, I've been real since day one
And a nigga keep saying I'm one song away
Fuck that, I'm 5 million dollars strong today!

See when You heard me doing that money machine shit, nigga
That mean I got that mother fuck'n sack bro
Nigga I make M's nigga
You know what I'm talking about
I show these niggas how to do this shit I'm the blue print nigga
Show these niggas how to make these millions, nigga
And I ain't drop shit but a nigga bitch off
You know what I'm talking about
Verse 2:
I'm in a two door coupe
With a see through roof
And the a dope boy roll and a Glock 9 too
Red bitch on the passenger, she semi cute
But her head some serious, so you know what it do
When I say I love my niggers, that mean I love my niggers
Yeah, I rap for living, but I gotta plug for my niggers
I talk cocaine, cause I know cocaine
Ain't on that criss cross shit
I'm trying to stay in my lane
Say I rap like I trap, I gotta stay on my game
I'm strapped 24/7 I got to stay on my aim
They say Keep it real Gotti I say I been doing that
They say the niggers are white, I say influence that
I'm on my li-li-liter shit niggas following the kid
But I ain't fucked up with it
The streets know what it is
(I'm on my li-li-liter shit niggas following the kid)
(but I ain't fucked up with it)
(the streets know what it is)
Verse 3:
My little homies keep telling me to smash on em
Met a bad bitch and I spend a little cash on her
Cope a new whip so I left the paper tags on it
Got a couple checks but I really hate to brag on it
Catch me in the club, Luis shoe, Louis rag on em
Standing on the couch, popping bottles dropping swagg on em
Zilla up next and I bet the pad on em
Soon as he said the name CMG drop the bag on em
Verse 4:
I mean you know shit crazy
Cause like the other night a nigga was in Atlanta
We fucking around on the internet
And we see a motherfucking iTunes ad
Like Yo Gotti January 10th
I mean shit counted thru me for a loop
Cause I didn't know nothing about it
And its like December 23
Verse 5:
I'm a real nigga 1st, get money 2nd
Break bread with my niggas, we like family so respect it
Bad blood in the camp and nigga feel neglected
I try to work it out before it get all hecked
But if its about a bitch, just know I don't respect it
And if you talking foul I hope its ain't in my direction homie
I say if you talking foul I hope its ain't in my direction homie
Interlude:
Ay see
I believe nigga got a problem they handle it
You don't talk, you don't tweet
If its all good its all good
Know what I'm talking about
Verse 6:
I'm from the city of the murders
Were industry niggas ain't never heard of us
They be like who the fuck is Gotti, nigga Google me
Oh I'm a fuck nigga, that shit must be new to me
I'm damn near 30 and a nigga ain't done shit to me
Put your hands on a real nigga then its 1st degree
Get it (pow)
Hit it (pow)
Split it
Thats all my niggas do is murk some
I'm trying to hurt some

Man, what happened to my real niggas
Man, what happened to the real niggas
They in the feds, they gone, I put my life in this song
Man, what happened to my real niggas
Homie, just feel my pain, this shit gon' drive me insane
I wrote this hear for all my real niggas
Man, what happened to the real niggas

You a real nigga, what happened homie
Heard you running with the enemy, you tripping homie
You wasn’t raised like that, that ain’t your background
You got a little money with niggas, that's how you act now?
Streets a motherfucker
Not to mention, niggas treat you like my blood brother
But once you cross that line, you gotta stay there
And if you playing both sides, know you got to lay there
Damn, pissed me off, and no more playing fair
Hundred bands and guns, that's what I call warfare
Ain't nobody safe, any nigga get it
Don't call my phone, ain't shit to talk about, you know you did this

Once upon a time you was a real nigga
But now you disloyal, you just a field nigga
What type of nigga your nigga brought from the other side
We don't shake hands with the enemies, we do homicides
It's Ridgecrest mafia for life, and fuck the other side
You never see me say a word, you just see gun fire
Cause gangsters don't talk, and drama don't slide
One thing I hate the most, a nigga playing both sides
Just know you don't slide, get his ass from both sides
Make him scream, oh lord, like he in church getting baptized
I'm on my fuck the world, don't really fuck with me
My young niggas, that's all I got, this other shit ain't nothing to me
Old ass niggas better sit down
Pussy ass niggas better get down
I need a ?, C.M.G. the motherfucking squad
Any nigga round me best sound hard
Nigga best be squad, down to do their time, to catch a charge
This a family nigga, and you must play your part
Now they say I'm crazy cause I go to war with the whole city
But fuck nigga, I give these hoes the business
And I put that on me, I ain't never give no statement
I ain't never copped no plea
I let money fight my cases, I get money and I go hard
I let haters do the hating
When you pussies ready to face me, I be right here just waiting
Matter fact I'm getting patient
Sipping on that hen' getting wasted
Imma' catch a murder one and I can taste it
How you get so far, then go back to the basis
I built up Gucci and Boosie, some of this shit you just can't shake it
Some of this shit, you gotta embrace it
Some of these problems, you gotta erase it
So I keep ?, fuck their bitches till I run these niggas crazy

And the rims by Asanti, but the shades by Bulgari

Plus if my mind on dine, he ain't taking nothing from me

Got headed on a hundered round cause that's how much the choppa shoot

Guess it be little better if a nigga was doing bad
But momma got a smile
Brother still wild
I gotta get this money, I just had another child
They say I'm getting fat, guess I'm eating good
20 racks in the motor, got my name under the hood, (Yo Gotti),
Sometimes I think back, I could've went fed
This a chance in a lifetime, I gotta think ahead

I got bass in the trunk, highs on the inside
Marshmallow paint, 49ers on the inside
Touchdown, a nigga going long
Field goal, extra point a nigga going strong
210 on the dash, Blue jean inside
White wit blue top, like the Yankees when I come past
Home run, that boy out the park
Bases loaded, world series, that boy hustle smart
My city rooting for me, the club owners mad
'Cause I won't come to kick it for under twenty-five bands
And you taking it personal I'm just tryna feed my man's
See you ain't a real nigga so that's something you wouldn't understand
But if it weren't for my homeboys and if it weren't for my fans
I would've been clicked on you bitches
Doing a quarter off in the can
But I'ma keep on grinding and keep on shining
'Cause that's what you can't stand
And I'ma kill you bitches softly every time I ride pass
What the fuck make you wanna compete with me?
Like you street as me
Running 'round here talking down
Bitch, you ain't use to be with me
Bitch, you ain't use to tote heat with me
Bitch, you ain't use to eat with me
Bitch I was thuggin' in Ridgecrest
Yo funky ass was somewhere down the street
Yo fuck ass ain't no real G
Tell me where they do that at
Gang bang in yo neighborhood
But 'round me wouldn't even throw up your set
Motherfuckers do anything for a check, okay, that's cool
But don't fuck around and let Project Pat or Juicy J get your ass wet
On another note, I'm the same nigga wit' mo' paper and more bigger
And whenever I'm in town, bitch, I'm right here on Shady Vista
My jewelry on, and my car parked, my shirt off with no pistol
Ain't none, nigga gon' take nothin'
My li'l niggas a shake some
My li'l niggas got mo' paper, my li'l niggas don't even rap
Runnin' 'round talk 'bout you got signed
Bitch, you still living in the trap
I got bass in the trunk, highs on the inside
Marshmallow paint, 49er's on the inside
Touchdown, a nigga going long
Field goal, extra point a nigga going strong
210 on the dash, blue jean inside
White wit blue top, like the Yankees when I come past
Home run, that boy out the park
Bases loaded, world series, that boy hustle smart2Embed",32555.0,Touchdown,

Gotti representing the streets so Swizzo let 'em feel the beef
Try to steal my flow but niggas know they ain't real as me
Back when I was whippin' chickens choppin' bricks in momma kitchen
Never knew that rap shit would establish me a mill ticket
Shinin', grindin', never mindin' niggas winin' bout a bitch
I'm combining' every line and perfect timing with this shit

Been having birds fuck what cha' heard I'm just a young dude

Fuck a rap nigga they ain't touched no bricks(fuck em)
Rapping bout this work and they ain't done shit(pussy)
Clown ass niggas should get ran off tha block
Yeen neva drawed down and hit a nig' witcha Glock
Yeen neva got a block an broke that bitch out tha wrapper
So quit sayin' you a dope boy, you just a rapper
Niggas playin' with this game, like it's a muhfuckin joke
This my muhfuckin' code, i give tha streets niggas hope


Let me clear up tha rumors, let me talk to the streets
All that publicity shit homes, that ain't no beef
Niggas killing in Memphis, head shots off the muscle
If u fucked bout the bitch, yo fault, u should neva cuffed 'er
One thing I learned from my brother, real killers don't talk
Gotta know how to move and I think like a boss
I spit the shit that I live, this the shit I was taught
This the shit I'mma die about, foreign cars doin drive-by's
Imma real nigga and I'm gone stead
Miss me with that fuck shit cause I 'on't play it
Young niggas with me, terrorists, code red
They tryna trick me off the streets so I can go fed

Drop 200 bands, on a 2 seater
You niggas broke, we are not equal
Gotti still hungry, grind like I'm 2 people
I'm on my young nigga shit - I know I am!
Out here living for today and I don't give a damn
A hundred bucks in a Camaro, black and red
Offset, the booty wide, it's sitting bow-legged
Threw the pipes on it, pin the stripes on it
Car talk back, (Kitt!) Michael Knight on it
This the life, homie, all my ice on me
Chandelier shit, without the lights, homie

Pop! Pop! D-O-A! you dumb or angry
Reach for my chain and it go like this: you want to, I'll bang you
Ain't nobody took nothing, ain't no coincidence
No face, no case, no fingerprints
Point the pistol at the witness, they ain't seen shit
Money turn a felony to misdemeanor, bitch
We like LeBroning from the line, nothing but heat and bricks
When it come to beef though, it's Dirk's free throws, we don't seem to miss
My whole team winning, I think I'm Mark Cuban
Run and gun, never know when we might start shooting
Who want it? You stand but my goons on it
And if you make a move on it, then I feel sorry for you, homie

All my hot girls bop for me
Go 'head and drop for me
D Boys rock with me
Come buy the bar with me
Dime pieces smile for me
And all my gangsta niggas wild for me
Throughout the crowd with me
(Verse 1 - Eightball)
This for them big, thick fine girls, diamond-studded belly ring
Niggas who be flippin' that work, screamin' money ain't no thing
Car clean, mouth full of gold with the princess cut rocks in it
Back pockets hangin' low because I got a Glock in it
Straight out of that Memphis, Tenn Orangemound for y'all niggas don't know
Come flip with a pimp, let me show ya how to nuke that swing like I was Nino
Premro, Fat Boy, Eightball whatever y'all niggas wanna call me
Call me for a hot sixteen I'ma shine in the booth like a brand new bling
But I don't sing I bust them flows that go so tight with the track
Bitches get freaky niggas get crunk and don't know how to act
I got the sack roll something, pop that 'gnac and po' it
Ya fine bitches pop that puss like ya know it

(Verse 2 - Yo Gotti)
I was movin' 'caine just doin' my thang
Down here in Memphis where we off the chain
Now, turn the top on my sixty-seven class then I'm switchin' lanes
I done served a fiend, sipped the lean, twenty-four inches don't cloud my screen
Roll candy paint, blowin' purple dank, they claim grip grain but I know they ain't
I'm posted in the club, we can get it poppin'
Ya violate my gangsta partner then it's bodies droppin'
I just come to party, get at shorty head
Do my thang, spit some game you know how Gotti play it
I'm like all these hoes gon' get it man
One of these hoes gon' get it man
From the 'Mound to the west to the north to the south
Yo Gotti gon' represent it man
No fitted man just a head band, Polo shirt and some Birdmans
Still thugged out and it ain't no secret
I got my paper out the drug zones
I got my paper out the gutter man
Sellin' bud man with my brother man
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days
You'd see why Gotti still love the game
My wrist, my neck, my ear, my hand, my mouth look like a light show
Yo bitch, my bitch, his bitch, her bitch just hit the flo' and get it low

Ain't nobody gon' keep it triller than me

I'm ball all out with the biggest G's and spit and throw the sixteen
When it come down to the south you know that I'm holdin' the key

If the trunk is popped it'll show in neon get it together
Cuz when I pull up at the valet man
Eyes is wide and them jaws is droppin'
Steppin' out the freshest clothes, brightest ice man the show is stoppin'
People start oohin' me eyein' soon as they see us

Walked up in Trezevant high with dat 38 under my shirt
They tried to kick me out mama came back a damn fool
They let me right back in, but wat I go and do
Skipped class, catch me on all 3 lunches, smoking og kush a nigga had da munchies
All the hurt I caused high speed chases from da laws
Neighborhood gang fight a nigga done it all
Ma overall I just want a better life
For you and my sister that's why I stop sellin' white

Made Manichee that weekend
Violate our management
Fresh up out a meeting
Chris Lighty told me stick to the streets
He got that business

Trying to make these millions
To the maserati I cop that for Easter weekend
Got to fill ourselves
But I can't find a ceiling
These little bone niggas mostly rim your bitches in here chilling
He's going up and down
Her neck looks like a yo-yo
She said she wants him in too
I told her that's a no-no
Be my baby mama
Need her, you my main hoe
Pussy ass rappers we ain't cool
And you know so
Plus I need a halo
Pisses me the H-off
Streets is my religion

And if I have to shoot a nigga, I'm just gon bail out
Kick up my feet, watch bet and kush my self out

Thanks the trap before I leave the stage, I must salute the plug
Thank the streets, thank every nigga that ever doubted me...

I mean basically, I named it ""four and a half""
Because it's a very special number to me: 125 grams
I mean, some people may not even know what it mean
But for the people who do, that's who it's for

Aight let me paint the picture
Use to always sit around talking bout
How you was known in the streets
When this music shit pop off he was out
Because he was so damn good at it
So you got to the top an the streets still needed you
What now

Once upon a time in a small city Memphis
It was some gangsta young niggas running round through north memphis
Getting money fucking hoes smoking kush
Chopper by the house another one by the bush 
Democrats no republicans like bush
So we had that killer cali we coming in by the bush
Shoot a hundred bet hundred it ain't nun to me
Caught a plug take that work that was sum to me
One move turned to another then niggas got greedy
Before you know it we rob the whole fucking city
Back against the wall cause now we going to war with the whole town
Caught some of my homies down bad with they guard down
Yes this is tom anderson reporting live w.h.I.g.v
And I'm coming to you from north memphis
Where massive gun fire has saddened the community
Where a young man was shot several times
Outside of the community grocery store
People let's please stop the violence
If anybody have any suggestions please dial 527 - gunz

A couple funerals had to mask up
Then the feds scoop have of the whole hood up
A couple niggas started pointing fingers
Around the time back to the basics dropped and I had a nice single
Had the whole world saying watsup
And the feds was trying to see what's watsup
But fuck ya they had 11 witnesses
Who said they bought some or sold some to me niggas all in my business
And this that real life no bullshitting
This that straight facts no fiction
I see hoe niggas and I just feel friction
Givem one to they head leave they top missing

Please don't get offended
I mean cocaine muzik it's the american way
Let's look at histroy those that get to the top
Never leave street mentality government business

Counting money coming from a consirt, I had it jumpin
Really that was nothing, back in 1990 something
 competed for better numbers
You ain't talking bout dollars, less you got a couple commas
He really ain't a plug, till he front a couple hundred
Standing in the crowd, niggas looking at me funny
Cause I'm smoking on that loud, and they know I really done it
I can blow a mill, shit I just copped twenty
But I gotta keep it trill, like nothing like trap money
 labeled a black dummy
Slave with no remorse, 
Went shopping for them blocks, my nigga just asked for me
 brown bag 

Cocaine music, cocaine music
Cocaine music
Cocaine, cocaine music

I dream  the kelos come white
Put more faith in the scales than my one mic
 like antifreeze
I handle the keys from the corners to the drop
Got hit with a batch of  that's 
In that candy drop, chroam, missing roof
Or ice cream paint job, I got a sweet tooth
 past do
Million dollar baby 
Consume hype, toss that chicken like food fight
 niggas lose site
 four hours long
 ship a bird on
And when they touch down, they gon buy

And Im on it nigga your momma can get it
Broad day no disguise how I do it nigga
You the type to close your eyes before you shoot a nigga
Im the type open fire shoot straight through a nigga
If it was a movie you'd be fired cause its too explicit

Watch the news with my crew just to make sure we ain't missin
Mister landlord mister im so fuckin hoody
Yeah its a handgun bitch but it shoot chopper bullets

If you wanna buy some head, pick her up and blow the dough
She from the nutta gutta south
Then she moved down to the east
You can move a million times but bitch you still go be a freak
She use to fuck with Triple C, now she fuck with Nimean
Her sister and them from Mo-East Mountain
That's a Memphis hoe, you know that pimping go
Say she went to Northside, graduated from Merrow
Say she went 2 TSU, transfer to UT Check
Now she fucking Star and them, they don't want to give her back
Say her head dumb dumb, very very dumb dumb
That's a known Memphis bitch, I know where she come from
I know what her tongue done, I know where her mouth been

She goin to, goin to, details you wouldn't know was true

And the other ones who had a couple hits, but barely even made it
When they doubt me or they out me, make me stronger, make me face it
But I know I’m not a phase, I'mma be one of the greatest
In beginning, when I first started and I had dreams
Didn’t wanna stop, wanna ta be a lyricist
Then I switch the whole flow up, then started rapping about dope, got caught on that jewelery shit
Before young Jeezy started rapping detailed about dope, I thought niggas don't wanna hear that shit
I could've done that shit 5 years fore him, but they come along with them sentences
Must have went to New York like a million times, got a mil’ on a table, I ain't even sign
Warner had two and I turned it down, did a lot of shit in this life of mine
I ain't have to help, I had to grind, no complaints
These rap niggas, I know em all, 99% niggas lying
It go industry, fake as fuck, you don't like it shut me up
Niggas saying hip hop’s dead, CPR, wake em up
Flat line heartbeat, game in a coma
Nigga, I’m a dope boy, I do what I wanna
Grew up up on that Outkast, every hood, I was an outcast
In the middle of my hood, what break three stacks, get a hundred twenty five in a glad bag
And we got big boy guns, hold hundred
That’s for any pussy ass nigga wanna run up
What it do, Ross? What’up, Wayne? Salute, Stunner, Gucci Mane
Niggas ask me why I never done a song with Plies
What's Understood don't got to be explained so I never replied
Race for the money, never get tired
Plug on the way, he never retired
Order a Hundred and put that on my name
Is death on the money, it’s blood on my chain
That .40 we got bodies, niggas killing for hobbies
We got hoes in the room, we got hoes in the lobby
Bitches fucking for free, niggas killing for pennies
CMG that the team, we in the streets and we winning
HOOK
Remember Sosa told Tony not to fuck with me
Then then Sosa sent them boys at him a hundred deep
Then Tony wana go in but he ass dead
So Tony should have listen to what Sosa said
But he was fucking with that dope and he wasn't focused
Read between the lines, I'm talking to you locals
I'm talkin to any nigga that want war
Then let me get my M's up, you don't want war

Not a plant, but a field
Not a field, but a dome

Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Fish scale, I’ll buy you what you want
Thousand bales, buy you what you want
A hundred squares, I’ll buy you what you want
Send it through the air, and buy you what you want

I got plug money, gotta ship it back in Mexico
Slot money make you shoot yourself like plexico
Blood money, you fuck ‘round, be the next to go
Oil money, I got tanks of gas like Texaco
Drug money, bitch, I’m running out of head spot
Shoe money, I had a hundred in a Nike box
Ho money, I took my bitch to ball in harbor
Watch money, what’s a forty for a starter
In Mexico they’re growing weed in the back yard
In Mexico get a pound, a couple one hundred, dawg
Exotic money, now I be riding in exotic cars
Switch my flow up just like future, now I got exotic bars
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Drug money it’s gonna buy you what you want
Fish scale, I’ll buy you what you want
Thousand bales, buy you what you want
A hundred squares, I’ll buy you what you want
Send it through the air, and buy you what you want

I got brick money, nine hundred for an ounce of yay
Streets dry, so nine hundred what they got to pay
Got a fifty in, got another fifty on the way
In magic city let the city know it’s time to play
White whip, stainless steel, bitch, 300K
I ain’t gotta rap, trap jumping I can stop today
Columbia, Columbians, I got ‘em on the way
Lawyer paid more money if I get popped today
In Mexico my girl plugged when I was 16
In Mexico I was getting ‘em for the 16
That’s a lot of money, now I’m riding in exotic cars
Switched my flow up, changed my future, now I got exotic cars

Always remember the rules before you put your hand in it

Before you put your hand in it
You got to be the man in it
You got to understand it, got to know the rules to the game
Got to sacrifice, got to know it's a five year sentence for a brick of white
That's if your record clean Lord knows it’s a poor sight

Never turn your back on niggas that you thug with

Soon Niggas go to jail, so that’s a day from hell
Young nigga oh well, thinking he a player
Now he living through his pictures on the wall and his mail
But he ain’t tell, so nigga I salute em'
And when he hit the streets again, making sure he eat again
He gon' be a beast again, hit em' with a key again

A 100 miles and running niggas gunning at the enemy
Niggas switching sides giving up like its the end of me
Niggas hollin' family but I know these niggas envy me
Pound game thugging to the muthafckin sentence me
I'mma trending topic. Top down bitch im riding in the 'rarri
If u don't like me then I'm sorry
Same OG, I'm just being me fuck a critic
I rap about this shit cus I did it
Life don't change, neither do the game
New niggas getting money but the rules stay the same
Who I'm gon' sign with? Who I wanna grind with?
That's my only question nigga CMG I'm dying with
Cocaine Muzik , cars, money, guns
Every nigga I fuck wit done went to jail, I made they bond
I never leave the house without my chain or my gun
Got on my dope boy guccis or a fresh pair of One's
(Talking:)
Yeah.. see nigga, see I feel like I'm one of the realest niggas that ever walked the face of earth, you know what I mean?
And that ain't got nothing to do with getting no money or nothing like that nigga. That's just bein 100
That's being 100 with yourself. That's being 100 with the niggas who 100 wit u, you know what I mean?
Nigga I got a lot of young niggas around me nigga and it's straight up love like family nigga cuz we'll kill for
Each other and that's on the real
(Verse 2:)
Murder was the case nigga, jump a hurdle win a race nigga
Then I put it in ya face nigga. Took a face on my case nigga
Told my lawyer go to trial, I'm doing it big in the meanwhile
If I lose, raise Mariah for me. If I die bust that fire for me
Pour out some liquor and get higher for me
I'm doing this one for my homeboys, I'm hollin ""Oh Lord"". Some shit we can't afford
I just be speaking from the heart but sometimes it rhymes
Am I a real rapper or just a nigga with lines?
I don't know, I'm confused. Do I supposed to be rich?
You know that ho ain't yo ho she just yo supposed to be bitch
Yo supposed to be clique. I don't want no allies
It's CMG homie and we don't franchise
I get green guys, off those white pies
Dope in that pot and it get baptized
Hallelujah! Bless my shooters
Serve my Jay's up, watch him hit that shooter
Fuck this rap shit, I dont fit in
All these fuck boys, all these fake friends
Streets on fire, plug on go mode
Streets so damn dry, I might get a truck load

Fake ass executives, trying to take care of my relatives
‘cause I’m out here on my grind and they won’t playing ball with me
Then I ... out that sack, then they start calling for me
Hello
These meeting is gonna set up your family for the rest of your life
Mister Gotti, we’re looking forward to doing everything with you in the future
Bitch I'm in these streets and I’m locked in
Critics saying I’m boxed in
Fuck all commercial, I'd rather flock ...,
I'll never change, I got blocks then
Hip hop, you need a flip flop, best albums, night grams
Whoever hot, you wanna do a song with
What's not something wrong with
Where the real niggas, where real gangstas
Who staying for something, I hear... for something
Told you that won’t find me strong, niggas must thought I was playing or something

I was an American Gangster before the movie

Off white vet with the off white diamond, pulled up to the light, and stop
The rims be spinning backwards, two door Viper with rally stripes
Now she stops in traffic, A coupé on standing rims in '08
Boy, you need your ass kicked, the Viper come's with two seats
I call that bitch the cat truck, police tried to whip me over
So I drove it faster, six racks worth of hundreds on me
I don't keep a gas card, prototype twos-eat Camaro, East Atlanta NASCAR


Guns on deck, fifty round my neck, one hundred's in the car
I die for my respect, car jack who, gone rob who, gone slap who
Bitch, I'll kill you, oh oh, them boys a fool, doing donut's in the Lam

Whoever hot, you wanna do a song with

And the other ones who had a couple hits, but barely even made it
When they doubt me or they out me, make me stronger, make me face it
But I know I’m not a phase, I'mma be one of the greatest
In beginning, when I first started and I had dreams
Didn’t wanna stop, wanna ta be a lyricist
Then I switch the whole flow up, then started rapping about dope, got caught on that jewelery shit
Before young Jeezy started rapping detailed about dope, I thought niggas don't wanna hear that shit
I could've done that shit 5 years fore him, but they come along with them sentences
Must have went to New York like a million times, got a mil’ on a table, I ain't even sign
Warner had two and I turned it down, did a lot of shit in this life of mine

Grew up up on that Outkast, every hood, I was an outcast
In the middle of my hood, what break three stacks, get a hundred twenty five in a glad bag
And we got big boy guns, hold hundred
That’s for any pussy ass nigga wanna run up
What it do, Ross? What’up, Wayne? Salute, Stunner, Gucci Mane
Niggas ask me why I never done a song with Plies
What's Understood don't got to be explained so I never replied
Race for the money, never get tired

Order a Hundred and put that on my name
Is death on the money, it’s blood on my chain

Remember Sosa told Tony not to fuck with me
Then then Sosa sent them boys at him a hundred deep

Ask god if he can bullet proof the coupe they want to wet me up
Work been commin in bad still gotta get it off
Since dis shit ain't taking soda

Put me on a microscope he rapin but he sellin dope
Watch a nigga long enough and you find what your lookin for
Homies in the feds yeah im sceard they tryna lock me in
We don't talk on phones we sent message through a mutual friend
Keep the talkin to minimum expessaily to they sendin someone
Cause I know that they listen to a nigga like a intercom

Hit me on the phone sayin he tryna get a four way
Ask if I can cook it up say he met me half way
I was kinda rushen em just thinkin I'mma bustem up

Ridin down a back street lookin in my rear view
Notice someone followin me once I pass him
So I smashed on that gas doin that dash in that hot persute

Don’t come around again
I believe it, I believe it
Don’t come around again
I believe it, I believe it

When a nigga talk dope, they don't never speak about the truth
They don't never speak about you
When a nigga talk real, you don't even know how it feel
How you gon' tell me what it is
When a nigga say Gotti, all they know is Leer and Maserati
All they know is turnin' up the party
All they know is young nigga with a whole bunch of rollies
All they know is young nigga gon' catch a body
When a nigga say north, nigga talkin' bout jumpin off the porch
With a bag full of 50 St. Croix
Nigga talkin' bout trying to fight a gun charge
Trying to fight a brick charge, lawyer ain't show up in court
When a nigga say trial, nigga talkin' bout gambling with his life
That’s how a nigga really earn his stripes
When them niggas say he don't fuck with me like I fuck with him
He ain’t finna do something right
That nigga finna snitch, man I knew that nigga was a bitch
Man I knew that nigga wasn't shit
He ain’t got no heart, man I knew that nigga was risk
Should've killed him when he we went on that lick
When them niggas say bang, nigga they be talking bout my squad
Nigga they be talkin bout my cars
When they say white, nigga they be talkin bout bricks

I believe it, I believe it
Don’t come around again

When them niggas say bitch, we don’t really mean no harm
She ain’t gotta be so offensed
When a nigga say ho, ain’t say you know what you is
Shawty you ain’t got to be so defensive
Niggas say you bad, that’s a compliment, not literally
Half naked pictures, but you lookin' for a gentleman
Instagram your whole life after the pull of trying to get your followers up
Sold your soul to the internet
Damn, damn right it's a cold world
Losing sleep by my little girl
Damn Mariah hope you don't be like Maliah
Damn sure hope you don't be like oh girl
True when a nigga say he like you
Niggas sayin' what he gon' do?
Tell a nigga he a lie
Tell him that a real bad bitch get his own so that money can’t buy
When a nigga say he ballin, ask him where his title and his deeds at
Not where his clothes and his keys at
Ask him is he renting, tell him that your daddy was a real baller
He was blowin' money by the seasons
Let him know you good, left a couple mil in the will for you
Big burner rays right that’ll kill for you

Fuck you, fuck you (Pussy)
Fuck you, fuck you (Tell your bitch I said)

Me
Ass up, face down
One night only, I'm from out of town
Pound, new rules, we ain't waiting on it
And if that pussy good, we spend cake on it
Plane ticket, hotel, new bag, new Chanel
Giuseppe sneakers, his and hers
If you a hater, I just got two words

Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you (Tell a hater I said)
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you (And tell your bitch I said)
You, and the bitches that you came with
All in my section drinking my shit
You ain't fucking, you ain't sucking, what you doing, ho?
Instagram and taking pictures, but you don't know me, though
Damn, she said that she a fan
Yeah, I understand, but I want to get in her pants
'Cause she thick as fuck and she sticking her tongue out
She said she don't fuck with rappers
And I'm like, ""what you talking about, bitch?""

Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you (I got two words for you)
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you (Tell a hater I said)

Oh, I said fuck ‘em
I don’t like 'em, I don’t love 'em
When the money come
Homies turn to haters, I don’t trust 'em
If the brick ain’t coming with a stamp, I don’t touch it
I want that BMF with the Scorpio when I’m bustin'
Like a bitch when she twerkin’, y'all niggas workin'
Clown-ass niggas, we should put you in the circus
In the cage with the lion, let him have you for dessert
And testifying on your homie, took a deal, but was it worth it, nigga?
I met this bitch, she said “my friend, she want to fuck you""
I like your friend, but really, though, I wanna fuck you
And if I get my roadie, though, he gotta to fuck too
Now put your middle fingers up and scream
Haters, nigga mad at the paper
Big crib, ten cars, twenty acres
Twenty chains, ten watches, I'm a jewler
Lil’ watch with the jest, don’t let it fool you
I could school you on how to look like money
Hustler of the year, could write a book ‘bout money
Don’t pop them bottles tryna impress them hoes
With your re-up money better tell them hoes, bitch

He was the corner back, the running back, and the wide receiver
Most importantly my nigga I loved him like a brother
It was like my mother his mother we shared the same brothers
And I'm getting money, 16 I had a hundred stacks

Poverty's paradise
If you want it, you'd better think twice

Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, but how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

In a nigga, yeah, no love in a nigga
If I could paint a picture, I'd show a image
Of a dog ass nigga, yeah, a raw ass nigga
Popping pain killers, riding for the cause
Four dogs with them pistols, na-na-natural born killers
He sold crack to his mother, turned his back on his brothers
Killed his partner for the plug, he think everything a hustle
Co-cold muh'fucka, holmes numb
Black heart, no feelings, just a gun, fo'real
He was raised in the trenches
Not to mention, all the hoes they had dissed him
So holmes think the whole world against him
Played ball, coach benched him, grandpa, Klan lynched him
He was raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis
Kinda hard to adapt
So holmes turned to a strap
Didn't succeed, tried rap, couldn't fight, got slapped
Shot dice, do crap, did time, back out, damn
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

Hey, no love, no love
How you gon' survive now? No love, no love
Yo Gotti, lemme paint a picture for these niggas, hey, huh
Here’s a, voice for the voiceless
My words like, multiple choice to the choiceless
Emerge like, a searchlight in the darkness for this young black carcass
My niggas either join the Armed Forces or they corpses now
In God we trust, but it’s bucks that we worship now
Boy, that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
See I seen just what that fast money gon’ come and do to people
Hit a lick, it was a hit, he said, “Let's go and do the sequel”
But his, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it, nigga wasn’t ‘bout it now
Feeling guilty, what would momma think about me?
Told 'em, ""Think about it, nigga, won't you think about it now?""
But he was money hungry, plus he trigger happy
So they hopped up in the Caddy, burners packed just like a stadium
Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM
Momma in denial like her baby boy on trial
For a murder that he ain’t commit, tears soak the handkerchief
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga

Fo'real, fo'real
Lights off, no candles, roaches all around the kitchen
Nigga hungry, mom embarrassed so she don't want us to mention it
Grandma wanna help but momma ego kicking in
She a hustler, she don’t need no help raising her kids
Bills came, got evicted, stayed strong
Square business, she ain’t never showed weakness, real shit
That created the hunger, and that make the monsters
Got the game from our momma, that’s some ill shit
Thirteen on the block, he was a lookout
In the kitchen, on the stove like it’s a cookout
Young nigga mastered the game, could put a book out
Right when he thought it was over, he got took out (bang!)
Brains leaking, nigga sneaked him, he ain't even seen it coming
He a hitta, he wasn't focus so he died over nothing
No revenge, with his friends shooting dice, bet again
Win or lose, take it all, took out by his own men
And from the ground, we build it to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
It’s cold blood in a nigga
The streets left no love in a nigga
Started from the ground, building to the sky now
Watch it fall down, how you gon’ survive now?
Yeah, it’s cold blood in a nigga

I call her thirst trap shorty, oh, haha

Ay you know
They say its a man's job to respect a woman
But me personally
I feel like a woman 'posed to give a man something to respect
Now it ain't wrong for thinking that is it
So I ain't wrong for thinking this

Want me to buy you a bag but is you worth it
Now I ain't perfect
And I just followed you on Instagram
Are you really into women and you get around, no I ain't judging
I'm just asking if that's fair to say
But either way it's my opinion, you know, give or take
I told this model chick
Little girls look up to you and the things you do
Every nigga you work with, you're screwin'
So you know when she grow up, you know what she gon' do
She like, you don't know me, you don't pay my bills
You don't know my struggle
I'm like, that shit real but it is what it is but I know you lying
I know what's real, I know your worth
I know that purse, ten bands shawty, you can't pay your bills
You one of them?
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn from me
That you earn from me, that you earn
What you make me do
That's what I'm gonna do, for you
Girl, I'm gonna give you the respect that you earn from me
That you earn from me, that you earn
What you make me do
That's what I'm gonna do - give you the respect you earn

I kiss on your neck, what you wanna get out of this?
Would you feel disrespected if I said you fat as shit?
If I called you my bitch when I'm with my partners
See it as a badge of honor
Or just be like no Wale, don't call me out on my momma's given
Namesake but she whispers mine when I'm in her thighs
And I leave her in her feelings 'cuz I never leave her dry
Some ill advice, lying to her is ill advised
She know these Jones from a Jone but I still give her time
I try to follow her, everybody want her
Ain't worry about nothing, she gon' work that body
And I unfollow though my eyes
Still on her knowing I'm still caught up
I call her thirst trap shorty

She lives for the night life
And that's all right
But she wants to be treated like somebody wife
But you can't be table-hopping in the club
Trying to drink free
Then come back to my table
Trying to stand next to me
Oh no, oh no, oh no

Real nigga shit boy I hate lames
All my nigga sell dope or gang bang
Me and cash get the act right
You ain't in a foreign you don't look right
Act right, act right
Money don't fold if it act right
Act right, act right
Niggas playin' games you can act right

I'mma tell ya off top mother fuck free Boosie
Ridin' in my Lamborghini with the dope man uzi
Thinkin' came with a step might be the shit
I got a rooster in my Rari might be your bitch
I said I pull up in this bitch in that Aventador
Make you bitch pass out straight hit the floor
Said I never seen a car like that before
What's that thang stickin up said thats the door
I told YG I'mma go ride the whip
You just hangin' out the window ghost ride the clip
I made my first quarter million dollars off the blow
He want a nine piece chicken took that to-go
I'mma tell ya like this, ya'll motherfucker listen
Kilo all day motherfucker I'm trippin'
But if you run up on me thinking I'm slippin'
Michael Jordan with the chopper bet I hit you like Pippen act right

Act right, act right
Money don't fold if it act right
Act right, act right
Niggas playin' games you can act right
Goin' goin' back back to the bank
Rest in peace to my safe
I'mma fly nigga nigga I take your ho
I'll have to leave her if she did me like Coco
The devil talkin' to me, but I dont hear him
Act like I'm deaf like So-So
Fuck you, fuck him, fuck them
Fuck my ex and her cohorts
Hundred bottles in the club, for no reason
Niggas start trippin boom bow dope fiend
Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt
I'm in the Fendi store I dont need help
All gold everything like Trinidad
I went to high school with you bitch you been a rat
I don't got money problems, I got trust issues
Two things I gotta stave with two pistols

Act right, act right
Money don't fold if it act right
Act right, act right
Niggas playin' games you can act right

Yeah, I had to do it for the street, hoe
Do right, getting money, living life hoe

But keep it and keep it
But keep it on the low
And bring it to the do'
Butkeep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
You bought the shit from Yo
You gotta play it off
You know I rap now
Don't get it twisted though
I'm still strapped man
I still vote for my people I got insurance
Don't miss the blowout sale it's on clearance
And bring it to the do'
But keep it on the low
Don't let nobody know
You bought the shit from Yo
I'm from the North Pole, they call me Young Santa
I'm movin' bricks from Memphis clean to Atlanta
And everythang in between
Them niggas down in Cashville payin' 900 for a pound of green
When the sun rise I got a lot of fiends
I'm sellin' 20 rocks the same size as lima beans (two for one)
You want to purchase one get the second half off
But this ain't dealers nigga I'ma blow your ass off
If I ain't in my Benz you see me in a rental
I'm bout to rap with a 9 piece chicken dinner
You know they goin' fast better get with me nigga
45 for the home team rest of you 250 nigga
A thousand grams of white that'll bring me 20 stacks
If it ain't comin' in a wrapper I'ma ship it back
Cause niggas steppin' on the shit and recompressin' it
But I don't plan on payin' them anyway so I ain't stressin' it

And bring it to the do'

You bought that shit from Yo
You work a small shift I'm pullin' all nighters
You got no hustle but Gotti got the titles
New school hard top old school  drop top
Flipflop got the yellow and the white rock
Lit up like a chandelier diamonds shinin' everywhere
And not to mention I'm a cash money millionaire
While you fantasize and dreamin' bout a hundred stacks
I'm coast to coast and across the border tryna get a sack
My main bitch she a soldier and she ride with me
The people scooped her tried to turn her to an eye witness
But I ain't worried about it cause she ain't seen shit
My lawyer say I'm good but I don't trust him they don't mean shit
They say you kill a nigga that shit be on your conscience
They say I'm young and having money so I'm money laundering
Bullshit nigga, I got that show paper
That ten here, ten there, that fo sho paper

And bring it to the do'
But keep it on the low

Catch a charge I pay it off
Trunk full of white see blue lights I'm goin' out like set it off
Hundred years nigga fuck that shit
Thousands knots you bet that shit
Cop a plea, tell on my niggas? real niggas don't accept that shit
With 0 tolerance sweep we be landlords
For 16.5 a pop they bring it to the door
Like I'ma tell em no shit what the fuck for
I know some niggas out south payin' 20 for it
I'm tryna profit 8 all night all day
Once a week five ten go and cop that new Benz
Yayo got my ass in, bullshit got your ass out
Whoever said crime don't pay don't know what they talkin' bout
In the hood my credit good
Old school with plenty wood
Stop and go's, 24's, got it all from slangin' O's
Yea, got it all from slangin' O's, 24's,  stop and go's

Ok the beat go hard but I go harder

But dem bitches make the lambo look a little more harder

Blood gang crips too we gon' eat regardless
See me on the news ,yeah I beat dem charges
All them young dudes were runnin,duckin, had em dodging
Blood shed, my niggas in the fed
My nigga Gucci die I can't let nuthing slide
Ridgecrest where I resign Ridgecrest what I provide
Young nigga with them choppas ‘cause I know they gonna ride
Fuck if I die today I went to church I pay my tax
I leave my son a couple million dollars so I did alright
Harder, ain’t no nigga in this streets that built like me sold bricks like me
Mexico, took trips like me
Texaco ain't nothing but gas
Thou shoot, thou shall not pass
I break bread so no fuck me nigga i’m a real nigga and I was built to last
Hard hard i’m hard hard hard i’m hard
Hard hard i’m hard
In the kitchen I whip it harder
Top drop riding harder
Hard hard i’m hard hard hard i’m hard

Real nigga I live harder
Hard hard i’m hard

The streets go hard but I go harder
I know what Diddy meant mo money mo fucking problems
I know young money like im dwayne carter
Remember my life a real nigga if I die tomorrow
I’m harder met a bitch in the mazda
Put the bitch in the range rover
Cause she suck dick till tomorrow
Every 24 hours, 24 brick of powder
24s on my Panamere,50k on the chandelier
House look like a castle,  bitch white like alaska
Got instrumentals, sold all white, on my mercedes shit nasa
Pulled off in that 'rari took off like im nasa
Nigga playing dem games with me she’ll fuck you if you answer
She smarter better get she harder better yet you pussy
Then why them bitches charge ya'

Strip moneys strip moneys got on my wall
I’m going so hard I know I got more than dough
Got the beamer the bentley triple-black Mercedes-benz
Got me 5 mill in cash time to get it again
From reebok to Ciroc came a long way from the blocks
Baby girl all wet cause shit i've driven it rocks
Licking shots that you pussies my stock fresh shot through the roof
As I shoot for the stars im shooting buying a coup
I know I won't live forever but stocking up like I will

Stop the beat let's get something understood -- I stay g'd up
Maybach with my feet up, AK when I creep up
My young niggas rep Blood Gang, my OGs rep Hoover
All I got is shooters, all we do is shoot up
Little bad bitch got no ass, she must work at Hooters
Remember being in New York when the towers blew up
Now I got a 911 Porsche with the blue guts
Rims'll make you throw up, something to make you blow up
Niggas getting little money, when you gon grow up?
Louis from the toe up, street nigga, so what?
Louis XIII and I just tell them bitches pour up

Pounds of midget, green and thirty bricks inside a Honda
He don't speak any English, all he know is numbers
And my Mexi plug me he gon get me through the summer
He don't know my name, him there just a runner
He pick it up and drop it off then he gets him yonder

But I live in a white house so I feel presidential
I pledge allegiance to the flag, United Streets of America
In God we trust, in one we stand, I'll always be a hustler

Catch me at the tables, hundred thousand a marker
Fucking with the wrong set, ain't even perform yet
Short one to AC, Vegas we took the long jet
Blue chip in the field, red one on the horn bet
Money straight, work good, connect ain't did me wrong yet

Go girl, a go girl
A top notch thoroughbred, pro girl
She go-go live, she go-go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it
She a go girl, a go girl
An all night putting on a show girl
She go live, she go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it

I got this girl that’s on so sadiddy
She call and say she miss me
I tell her I’ma visit next time I’m in her city
I turn your world to Gotti World, shorty bring your ticket
Jimmy Choo and Red Bottoms, shorty we can kick it
I take her on trips, her boyfriend be tripping
Text her phone a million times, but she ain’t trying to hear it
Tattoos and piercings, Gucci shoes for chirren
Kids just as fresh as she be, She serious
All I do is ball, and all she fuck is winners
Take her to the mall, she don’t want to go to dinner
She a go girl, and I’m trying to get with her
Have you looking right, I had to follow her on Twitter
She’s a go girl

Go, go, keep on going
I be somewhere throwing money, blowing on that potent
Money in my bank account, pockets hella swollen
And a model girlfriend, so for them cameras we be posing
We just go–go anywhere we wanna
Got a weed connect from Tennessee to California
Twenty grand in Pari, blowing on that Mary
Your bitch on my Johnson cause I’m balling like I’m Larry
And I play my part
I’m out here with them bosses, and she notice from the start
Get thirty K to show, so we both be going hard
Don’t smoke or roll the weed up
If she broke she get her cheese up
Ever slow, she’ll up the speed
Cause she a go girl


OK now whoa there, keep going, throwing
That big booty, dong in
She wear her heart on her sleeve
Now she just Comme des Garconing
I wake up and show you what this cock-a-doodle-do in the morning
I swear that pussy so good, I wish I could clone it
Go girl, go girl
My new bitch, your old girl
She bust it open for my like a showgirl
Call me king, then tell me that it’s your world
Body Jamaican, but the vagina is Asian
I swear that’s hourglass shape and
That reminds me time wasting
Fuck around, I might taste it
And if I throw it back at her, then she probably gonna chase it
Because she’s a go girl

Chea! (Yeah)
Ay, you know I'm lookin' for a five-star bitch, talkin' bout
(Burr! Burr!) I'm talkin' homegirl
Be lookin' like she just stepped outta magazine (Gucci!)
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice box wet, and your head somethin' fine
This time, it's gonna be somethin' serious (yeah!)
I want a five-star bitch, I need a five-star bitch
I need a five-star bitch, I want a five-star bitch

Gotti, here go twelve bars, Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more, '09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed, might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me, best money I ever spent
Hey, I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not, yeah all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta, look up Gucci girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel, you can meet me
That's a five-star bitch, that's a five-star bitch
Now that's a five-star bitch, now that's a five-star bitch
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice-box wet and your head somethin' fine
Then you a five-star bitch, ay you a five-star bitch
Ay you a five-star bitch, ay you a five-star bitch
I want a five-star chick, I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick, I want a five-star chick

It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit
I'm the realest nigga walkin', and this the remix
And still I'm out here lookin' for a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her with a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla, she ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga, she ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic
That ain't a five-star bitch, that ain't a five-star bitch
That ain't a five-star bitch, girl ain't a five-star bitch
(Trina!) See I'm a five-star bitch cause I ain't that other bitch
She been strugglin' for hers, from the womb, I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money and the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina, see the proof, mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star bitch eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like ""Coming to America""
All my Louis luggage, you see my bag how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport like I'm in a parade
On my hologram, loggin' on to E-Trade

That's a five-star bitch, that's a five-star bitch
Now that's a five-star bitch, now that's a five-star bitch
If your credit score high, feet and nails stay fly
Keep your juice-box wet and your head somethin' fine
Then you a five-star bitch, ay you a five-star bitch
Ay you a five-star bitch, ay you a five-star bitch
I want a five-star chick, I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick, I want a five-star chick

I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers and my cookie's always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' ""Fuck 'em"" with a dildo sign
Five, little mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter? Harajuku hyphen Barbie
I'm hot, I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in
When you hit the stage, they was booin' and leavin'
Young Money, red flag, no more auditions
Ask Lil Wayne who the five-star bitch is

I do it for the hood, I do it for my town
I do it for the South, North Memphis to the Mound
I do it for the A, Westside Bankhead

I do it for Alabama, them niggas in the 'Ham
I do it for Mobile, because they be going ham
I do it for the Lou', I do if for the Chi

And this is how I ride, my rims on glide
Six inch lips, twenty six inch tires
I do it for Detroit, because they be going hard
I do it for the 'Nap, 40 F and Boulevard
We get it in as soft, we turn it into hard
This how we kick it, in the kitchen with a Pyrex and a pot
One down to my vatos, because they be showing love
It's been seven years and counting, so I do it for my block

No security how I roll, my niggas blowing dro
Hoped a lobby full of hoes, to every Gotti show

Fall off with a bougie nigga, three, four, my young stupid niggas
Two ounces, two different pistols, Westside bitches fucking with us
Bankhead niggas smoking with me
Simpson Rd., they drinking with me
Eastside, Westside, Northside, Southside, off-side
They be linking with us
Fifty minutes balling out, but I didn't have a problem
Stupid watch and crazy, robbers have respect for robbers
You might get robbed on the spot, feet up in the parking lot
Hit the leave by two o' clock, no one's in my parking spot
ABG duct taping them, Outsiders act safe and then
Club packed, ain't no space in there
Fuck around, eat your face in there
Hookers got that gas in there
So what's inside your Swisher fool?
Don't touch, no harassing them
Because Zone 6 hold your pistol tooEmbed",,For The Hood,['Gucci Mane']

Plug talk money, money talk plug
Teenage numbers when we speak about drugs
15, 16, 17 fine
18, 19, 20 too high
My plug talk money, my money talk plug
Teenage numbers when we speak about drugs
15, 16, 17 fine
18, 19, 20 too high

Cocaine dreams, sky is the limit
You can make a lot of money or you can do a large sentence
My plug don't speak English, he can barely say a sentence
All he know is numbers, charge me nothing close to twenty
Sixteen flat, front me one time
Call it statutory rape when he charging Kobe Bryant
I'm trying to profit eight, like that nigga in his prime
I'm shooting to L.A. to get my work e'erytime
All I gotta say, I'm cool like Dre
I'm boss like rick from M.I.A
Yo Gotti!
Nigga say had keys for the fifteen, only thing gotta cop more than fifteen

Teflon Don
Lemme holla at em
I fell in love with Fendi as an adolescent
Now it's Aston Martin money in my momma mattress
Copped me a Caprice, i shatted on them Daytons
Gotti got the cuddy but his stuntin' so contagious
Don't speak about my plug, my plug barely speak
?????? I keep putting teenagers on the street
We ballin' in the club, popping bottles as we speak
Multiple M's in my account, my money on the streets
I'm pouring money in it, 'til we got in Tennessee
I count it when I want it cos my niggas never steal from me, (loyal)
Keys in the ignition, keys in the kitchen
Large revenue, residue seen on the dishes
Profit mandatory, maintaining the lifestyle
My pedicure large, two attorneys for the trial
She sell a lot of ass, I got a lot of cash
Four Louis carry-ons, hit the helicopter pad


A thousand and eight grams
Divided by four
Two-hundred fifty-two
Multiply it by four
That's 16 racks, I'm panning at the max
Seventeen-five cause I gotta get some tax
Teenage white girl, but if I say she black
You know we talkin' code, that mean that bitch ain't comin' back
My plug don't speak English, write down everything you say
But I don't give a fuck cos I only want the yay
I'm cocaine crazy, think I'm goin' insane
15, 16, 17, keep running through my brain
I front a couple bricks, however you want to play it
When I'm with that tab, you know you walking dead
Dead man walking, I can see obituary
We enjoy the money, but the dope game scary
Bitches turn into enemies, friends turn into snitches
The cars draw attention, and the money fuck with bitches

All I ever wanted to do was live the life
Money, drugs, cars, clothes hoes
Brick, paints, pounds of dro fa sho
A young nigga living how he supposed ya know

I got sixteen 28 grams broke down to dimes
What's my life like nigga its a constant grind
You got seven eight or nine you can push on
Cause I'm a selfish nigga I want 10 strong
Oh no it happened again
Let me get a good flow of that dro again
Got phone blowin up like a high school bell
Plus the price sky rocket like dope in jail
Break it down in small portions fuck sellin a O
You'd rather make seven or eight or cock bound for da 4
I'm a hustla far from being a busta nigga
You got good game but still don't trust ya nigga
You can catch me in the neighborhood winter or summer
Spring or fall cause nigga I be selling it all
From junts to blunts blunts to bags and bags to O's
O's to pounds I'm just holding it down
 x2

I got 36 ounces blocked up pure yola
Make it times 2 once I hit it with the soda
Whip it up good in a beacon and a blender
Have it rock hard plus white as december
I switch up my raps yo I never go the same way
Plus I get a different prepaid every 30 days
So if I get jam I know where it came from
Rub my shit suitable never serve unusual
All money ain't good and all money ain't fine
Some money come with blood and some money come with time
Some money can't spend and some money ain't safe
Money in the wrong way I'll lead you to the wrong place
 x2

I got 8 or 9 paints and a bottle of kay row
And I woundn't give a fuck if you nod or stay woke
I just got back from the N Y C 250 a paint
Back in memphis tenn with drank
50 a ounce after I done added the bounce
45 get the nine and every dollar gone count
I'm a hustla don't make me say it again
I ain't trying to please a nigga I'm trying to stack some ends
The strong survive while the weak slowly dying
I'm congruent to them boys I'm out there slanging them pies
They never stop trying they never give up they gotta succeed
My life is like the saying nigga crack speed or weed

Steady chasin paper out here running these streets

Back with my guys
Back 22 for them pies
I'm back rollin' clean
Back lookin' mean at niggas
That's throwin' up signs
Lettin' off rounds for mine
Back in the hood
Like my niggas think I should
But knockin' on wood
They got a nigga back on that good
Back on a mission
In other words I'm back in the kitchen
Water whippin' with my niggas tryin' to sew up the city
Back in school
Gotti back to actin' a fool
But seekin' some knowledge
Southwest community college
Took hold a nigga
Enrolled and showed a nigga
When Gotti around, ain't enough hoes for niggas
Never did I
Get the big head or lie
And say I'm the mayne
I just said I'm workin' with change
And doin my thang
I can't help I don't trust hoes
Move birds on the low and seen a hundred or mo'

You wanna sue me? You wanna rob me?
Get your choppers come to my shows and try to mob me?
I took birds from your people
So you gone kill me
Say my beats be aight
But you don't really feel me
Dog, I ain't hard to find I be in the bay
Ridgecrest, Shady Vista street everyday
Sellin yay with my nigga G.B. and Todd
Lil' Mont Big G we all got heart
Rap shit aight but Im from the streets
Under all circumstances I gotta eat

What you know about thirty six o's in a drought
Double up make 'em bounce whoa...Look at my mouth
Blockburner nigga be rollin'
I go the title from (?) my shit ain't stolen
I'm watchin' TV's and DVD's
I'm thug bruh
One more time Dre and Shine
It's love bruh, It's love bruh

Dope just (???) and can't stop me from gettin this paper
Nineteen years a closet full of gators
Platinumed out chain beggets around my charm
One hundred fifty shots shtos four five caliber drum
Got 4 spots
One for the money
One for the drugs
A third spot for all of these hoes that I don't love
A fourth spot for me and my shorty that stayed down
The one who stayed strong and helped me through shady grounds
I'm a mean mugger,head buster
Nothin nice
I'm a street hustler
And my motto is rock ice
Streets is callin
Why not picture me ballin
Enjoy it while I got it cause one day I'm gone be fallin

Nope, It ain't happening, not over here. You ain't finna get a fast
Motherfucking come up over here shawty. HELL NAW!!
(Verse 1:)
Shawty was so real back in '96
Before the big life all the ice and all the bricks
Was small time grindin', high school rhymin'
Just broke up with my bitch so it was like perfect timing
She wouldn't a dime piece, she wouldn't a nine piece
But bout a six or a seven but was real sweet
But she was gangsta in other words thugged-out
But she was trafficing and manufacturin' drugs out
She was a little older she was a little bolder
Than all my other hoes, she drove a blue Corolla
We used to walk to class, I used to hold her folder
You know that in-between green shit to win her over
But fuck it, I'm a soldier, by now she should've noticed
That ya boy gone spit vocals or gone sell yola
She had nice goals future thought-out with a plan
But let me tell you how this bitch was trying to break a man
(Chorus)
Tryin', tryin', to break a man
I don't understand
(Verse 2:)
I told you she was real, at least I thought she was
I fucked with her for years, but that was just because
The situation seemed like it was meant to be
Until the money came I thought we was the perfect team
I worked a little harder, yes, i was like my father
All through the rain, sleet, and snow like it was no tomorrow
I had to stack my dollars, real niggas do real things like the lifetime in
Volume 1 of Sean Carter
I started flippin' cars, she started flippin' out
I tried to figure out what the fuck she bitchin' bout
She go a little crazy, she got a little lazy
No more with future plans and goals she only talkin babies
Im only talkin maybe
She constantly talkin' give me
Don't wanna hustle don't wanna work, I guess she out to get me
My money won't decrease by any circumstance
I ain't gone give you shit, you ain't gone break a man
(Chorus)
(Verse 3:)
Now we didn't have a pot to piss in
Shawty that's when you would listen
My down ass Memphis bitch, just playin yo postion
This before you had my son, this before I had a name
This before i copped the deal, this before I let it WANG
Told you was my plan was to try to come up on some change
Do my music out of town, i got to hoppin' on the planes
All the time away from home, shit you wasn't in my trust
While I'm out of town Rap Hustlin', doing this shit for us
All of a sudden you need some space, so I let you breathe
Went and got yo own place, and I was wrong for lettin' you leave?
Now I'm back to fuckin' niggas hoes, back to fuckin' bitched friends
Seen the spot I'm livin' in, got mad when I went and got the Benz
Now you want some dividends, now you wanna go to court
I give Nick everything he need, why you filing child support?
Left me, and now you hurt cause you ain't in my plans
You got me fucked up shawty and you tryin' to Break a man (DAMN)

I'm a North Memphis Survivor...Survivor
I'm a North Memphis Survivor...I'm a young nigga, money and power
I'm a North Memphis Survivor...Survivor
I'm a North memphis Survivor...I'm a young nigga, money and power

I was a young nigga thugging now, moms bugging now
Getting the Third Degree, for bringin drugs in the house
Getting my ass in, but my mama had to spoil it
Ran across my work, flushed my shit down the toilet
Fucked me up bad, but I tried to ignore it
Couldn't though, why? cuz I owed the nigga for it
125 grams eight one yo-la, 50 doller power tell blue motorola
Broke up my tube and my scale, I got no luck
Hold up, mama even threw away the soda
I remember this shit like it was yesterday
Falling in the house late, seent the look on mama's face
I knew something was wrong, by the smile and the smirk
You know the look you get when your mama really hurt
She shook her head, I dropped mine, ya'll already know
Boy you selling dope, get your shit you got to go
I'm on the motherfucking grind
You think this easy, you out your motherfucking mind
You could see the shit I'm doing, if you was blind
Straight up, I'm just trying to get mine

What am I to do now, where am I to go?
And how the fuck I'm gonna pay this nigga for his do?
Been looking for me, got a nigga kind of scared
And all the other niggas looking up side my head
They said he came through, layin low with his beeper
Two, Three cars Two, Three Desert Eagles
Got me a fresh quarter ounce and a beeper
Fuck it, I'm a grind till my bank get steeper
72 hours had 28 elither
Know what I'm talking about that uncut ether
Junkies lookin whoin, goose neckin and browsing
Word got around, I sold up the Public Housing


One week later had 4 and a split
Called up the nigga, told him told him come get his shit
I'm a real nigga, I just ran into some problems
All the time you think a nigga tried to slick rob ya
Thinking about my mama and them, I'm ready to go home
I'm fifteen years old, out here on my own
Mama let me back in, mama real strict
After school, straight home, no phone, no shit
Now doom in my room, I assume I was broke and it's true
So what the fuck a nigga gone do
Called grip, I heard he just got back off a trip with that shit
Man fuck it, I'm getting back with my click

So they assume that I'm straight with this shit
I'm straight with my clique, but otherwise these niggas be scared

I was bumpin' that 50 Cent
Then popped in that trap or die
Just finished a blunt of kush
Oh boy now I'm really high
I was sipping that Rozay Malt
Bumpin' that Carter III
I just may be paranoid
Or somebody's following me
That's why I don't like to smoke
Why I don't like to drink
While listening to that gangsta shit
If I'm so pie a nigga think
I jumped in my ???
Popped in my nigga plies
Stopped by Grandma house got the choppa'
Now bitches turned around
Onto North Memphis turnin corners
Trunk full of marijuanna
650 for a pound
Right now if a nigga want em
Went to ten-five percent
Ac blowin' out the vents
??? Dawg I'm just tryna pay the rent
I stopped by the corner store
Bought me some sandwich bags
Box of that baking soda
Headed back to the lab
Just got the phone call
Plug say the made it in
Say they gone front me 20
If I can pay for 10
Tell them to drop the price
Pay for them all today
450 thou' sitting back on they way

(Very good. I'll see you next time)

If she ain't with it, it's fine
She know I'm busy as fuck, that's my favorite line (Shoot off)
When the beat breakdown, make me feel like I'm breaking down them pounds
And my sister  in the kitchen with that newspaper on the ground (Keep going)
When them bricks came in, me and Nero had ziplocs in them ziplocs
Standing over that stove, making that pot go do the beatbox (Go, go)
Joe Biden with the big rocks, fifty pointers in the Rollie
Trackhawk and a Redeye, none of my shit stolen
Shirt off in that XL, might go luxury, uh-huh
Know I keep it on me so don't fuck with me, uh-huh
I used to ride a four and now I'm in the Forbes
I used to step on woodgrain now it's marble floors
I miss the Honda Accord, used to have a bitch in it with the bricks in it
Rental trucks tinted with the sticks in it, yeah, I been spinning (Twenty-four left)
Yeah, I been winning, big Gotti big getting it
No feelings, drug dealing, turned that shit to a business
Solo on all my mission, want no witness or codefendants
Never put no hoes in the business
No cap, no kidding, I take this shit to the graveyard
I got a million in that Goyard
I made a half a million out my room, oh yeah, our trap booming
I'm eating noodles serving consumers
Locked in with the streets, never move off rumors
Facts only
This that Cocaine Muzik, yeah, I'm right back on it (Almost there)
Gave my nigga a hundred K, turned his back on me
Ain't no love in these streets, ain't no loyalty
How opps beefing with me but they avoiding me

Oh boy now I'm really high
I was sipping that Rozay Malt
Bumpin' that Carter III

Or somebody's following me
That's why I don't like to smoke
Why I don't like to drink
While listening to that gangsta shit
If I'm so pie a nigga think
I jumped in my ???
Popped in my nigga plies
Stopped by Grandma house got the choppa'
Now bitches turned around
Onto North Memphis turnin corners
Trunk full of marijuanna
650 for a pound
Right now if a nigga want em
Went to ten-five percent
Ac blowin' out the vents

I stopped by the corner store
Bought me some sandwich bags
Box of that baking soda
Headed back to the lab
Just got the phone call

Say they gone front me 20
If I can pay for 10
Tell them to drop the price
Pay for them all today

If it was a movie you'd be fired cause its too explicit

This tha intro to my life, in-trip to my world
Ridgecrest Apartments, movin' dat white gurl
Posted up on tha corna, movin' dat marijuana
Glock .40 on my hip, holl'in out ""Chu ain't wann' it!""
My Glock stay cocked, rocks in a match box
Head garlind' on lock - I'mma go getta!
A nigga raided ya spot, conviscated cha block
And he didn't git shot - you'se a ho' nigga!
And I rememba you, do you rememba me?
8th grade leavin' school, rockin' up a quarter ki (Dat's wussup!)
T-tops on dat 'Z', I was passin' ya
Fish tail swervin' witcha bitch on tha passenger, side
Shawty, let's ride (Whuddup!), rims still spinnin' so shawty let's glide (Whuddup!)
She askin' me why, I don't git, high
Cause bitch, I make 50 off a 3,5

Alright, yeah
Money to be made, best believe a nigga got it
I run it myself, like a quarter back option
I pitch ya ten g's, tell a bitch to go shoppin
She buys ha' self some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
See nigga try to cook it, but know I dont play sucker
I'm all about my cake, I'm tryin to marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way, you know my whip game proper
Ya know for one ki, I see seven thousand dollars
Now I will shoot dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with Yo Gotti, he hit five straight points
We over here hustlin, we over here grindin
We rap about money, and a nigga might sign ya
Rap about me, and a nigga might find ya
Banana in ya ass, its what you hear right behind ya
Dope game bitch, let his momma where I bought em
You can holla at me, a feat


Another bird man with the bird land got a twenty piece
Gotti know charge to Memphis twenty-two a piece
Now I'm in the kitchen with a beacon and a blender
Low key and a rental with them things in the fenders
Yeah I'm goin ten grand, January to December
But theres no winter, summer, Gotti lookin like a winner
I'm goin back to Cali', I got to get the light green
Mexico Valley, you know they got them pan trees
Eighteen wheeler, now I'm on I-10
On my way to Memphis, I got to get my hands in
I come from the north where gangstas gon' grind
Bitch niggas gon' whine, and hustlas gon' shine
Everybody say they trappin'
But most of these niggas lying
I told Slim, I told Stunna, I'm waiting for my time
You can rock it and pop it click clack I shot em
Chopper bullets burn, I GOT EM

Yeah, yeah
Back where I started on my set and black
Hopped out the passenger side of my back
Under my nuts was two ounces of crack
But in my palm I had that chromed out Mac
Shinin on them bitches cause nigga I'm 'bout that
Flip a quarter bird, and score a whole sack
Pull up to the club in the old school 'Lac
With a bitch ridin fly, so how you love that
Its grind time nigga been about that
We flippin birds, let them hoes go to Saks
We livin large with the garbage bag fat
Want the money and the power, real niggas gon' stack
And ride fly, twenty-fives on the back
Plushed out nigga, keep a few stacks
Out the hood, bout money and that's that
And if you ever cross the line, best believe you get waxed

This ya boy Yo Gotti
Street Tunes Productions
We gon' ask everybody to stand up on this one
D Boys, this a gangsta party
Bun B, Eightball and this ya boy Yo Gotti

All my hot girls bop for me
Go 'head and drop for me
D Boys rock with me
Come buy the bar with me
Dime pieces smile for me
And all my gangsta niggas wild for me
Throughout the crowd with me

This for them big, thick fine girls, diamond-studded belly ring
Niggas who be flippin' that work, screamin' money ain't no thing
Car clean, mouth full of gold with the princess cut rocks in it
Back pockets hangin' low because I got a Glock in it
Straight out of that Memphis, Tenn Orangemound for y'all niggas don't know
Come flip with a pimp, let me show ya how to nuke that swing like I was Nino
Premro, Fat Boy, Eightball whatever y'all niggas wanna call me
Call me for a hot sixteen I'mma shine in the booth like a brand new bling
But I don't sing I bust them flows that go so tight with the track
Bitches get freaky niggas get crunk and don't know how to act
I got the sack roll something, pop that 'gnac and po' it
Ya fine bitches pop that puss like ya know it

I was movin' 'caine just doin' my thang
Down here in Memphis where we off the chain
Now, turn the top on my sixty-seven class then I'm switchin' lanes
I done served a fiend, sipped the lean, twenty-four inches don't cloud my screen
Roll candy paint, blowin' purple dank, they claim grip grain but I know they ain't
I'm posted in the club, we can get it poppin'
Ya violate my gangsta partner then it's bodies droppin'
I just come to party, get at shorty head
Do my thang, spit some game you know how Gotti play it
I'm like all these hoes gon' get it man
One of these hoes gon' get it man
From the 'Mound to the west to the north to the south
Yo Gotti gon' represent it man
No fitted man just a head band, Polo shirt and some Birdmans
Still thugged out and it ain't no secret
I got my paper out the drug zones
I got my paper out the gutter man
Sellin' bud man with my brother man
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days
You'd see why Gotti still love the game
My wrist, my neck, my ear, my hand, my mouth look like a light show
Yo bitch, my bitch, his bitch, her bitch just hit the flo' and get it low

This for all my street niggas and bitches
From M Town to H-Town
Free Pimp C, shit

Here we come, we keepin' it trill
Ain't no need to ask if you see
Ain't nobody gon' keep it triller than me
Myself and I that's Bun B
I'm a G, I'm a boss, I grip grain and I sip lean
I'm ball all out with the biggest G's and spit and throw the sixteen
When it come down to the south you know that I'm holdin' the key
I be in the Caddy rollin' on women damn near older than me
Them screens six inches or better, the stitches in the leather
If the trunk is popped it'll show in neon get it together
Cuz when I pull up at the valet man
Eyes is wide and them jaws is droppin'
Steppin' out the freshest clothes, brightest ice man the show is stoppin'
People start oohin' me eyein' soon as they see us
Women wanna be with us and fellas they wanna be us
We the G's and don't try to fight it, got dro and we fixin' light it
Laid back and that thang up on us we startin' to get excited
I'm ballin' with Yo Gotti and Eightball two of Memphis tightest
Cuz we havin' a gangsta party man everyone's invited

And her best friend

Caught the wrong bitch
Hit the wrong club, and got yo ass kicked

Them hoes stay jacking
Look at shawty weave

Shit its gonna help you get blazed up cuz you'll get smoked just like some perk
I don't play no games with these bitches
Lil' Chat straight gone let you know
If you disrespect my gangsta
Imma staright up wup you hoe! (straight up wup you hoe)

My main girl trippin', she think Im fucking off
Ask me 'bout some bitches, I had to play it off
Told me if she catch me then she gone cut a shine
Found a couple rubbers but I told her they weren't mine
She checked my phone, she watched my home, she searched my clothes
She asked me 'bout
Where I'm at and who I'm with
She tryna figure pimpin out
She cursed me out said I'm a dog
She sitting here crying and saying I'm wrong
Calling my phone all through the night and ask me when I'm coming home
Rule number 1, if shawty from the projects
Niggas takin' care of, you hoes better respect that
Nigga got her pregnant, you hoes better respect that

About my, so many girls, and so many wives

And i was tryin to explain to her on the phone
But im like what was the use of tellin the truth
Plus i was, trained at a youth to do what i do
So i just tell her some lies to make her feel good
Like, one day im movin you out the hood
It went from kisses and hugs to pushes and shoves but dat was all a part of F**kin wit thugs

She just, wanted to smile and wanted a child
But i was ruining her dreams by livin too wild
She said i need to calm down and act like a man
And my response was like what the f**k is u sayin
Cuz i was, so caught up into movin it white, and i was gone 24/7 a night
And i didn't give a f**k if i was wrong or was right
Cuz i was a d-boi livin a d-boi's life
And she was a school girl slash d-boi's wife
And it was in wit the wrong and out wit the right
Cuz she was trafficin' and manufacturin drugs
But that was all apart of f**kin wit thugs

We thought it would last 4ever and never would end
And we'd get mad at each other and try to pretend
Like we was callin it quits, wasn't speakin again
We went our seperate ways fo a couple of days
You know the seperate phase fo' hell of some days
But uh i regret ever doin her friend
But it was the need of the moment and u know us men
We just think wit out actin my man was back trackin but still i say what i mean and mean what i say cuz im real so play ya position and show us some love cuz that was all a part of f**kin wit thugs

She buys ha' self some clothes and she brought me back a chopper
See nigga try to cook it, but know I dont play sucker
I'm all about my cake, I'm tryin to marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way, you know my whip game proper
Ya know for one ki, I see seven thousand dollars
Now I will shoot dice, smokin on a joint
I bet with Yo Gotti, he hit five straight points
We over here hustlin, we over here grindin
We rap about money, and a nigga might sign ya
Rap about me, and a nigga might find ya
Banana in ya ass, its what you hear right behind ya
Dope game bitch, let his momma where I bought em
You can holla at me, a feat


Another bird man with the bird land got a twenty piece
Gotti know charge to Memphis twenty-two a piece
Now I'm in the kitchen with a beacon and a blender
Low key and a rental with them things in the fenders
Yeah I'm goin ten grand, January to December
But theres no winter, summer, Gotti lookin like a winner
I'm goin back to Cali', I got to get the light green
Mexico Valley, you know they got them pan trees
Eighteen wheeler, now I'm on I-10
On my way to Memphis, I got to get my hands in
I come from the north where gangstas gon' grind
Bitch niggas gon' whine, and hustlas gon' shine
Everybody say they trappin'
But most of these niggas lying
I told Slim, I told Stunna, I'm waiting for my time
You can rock it and pop it click clack I shot em
Chopper bullets burn, I GOT EM

Yeah, yeah
Back where I started on my set and black
Hopped out the passenger side of my back
Under my nuts was two ounces of crack
But in my palm I had that chromed out Mac
Shinin on them bitches cause nigga I'm 'bout that
Flip a quarter bird, and score a whole sack
Pull up to the club in the old school 'Lac
With a bitch ridin fly, so how you love that
Its grind time nigga been about that
We flippin birds, let them hoes go to Saks
We livin large with the garbage bag fat
Want the money and the power, real niggas gon' stack
And ride fly, twenty-fives on the back
Plushed out nigga, keep a few stacks
Out the hood, bout money and that's that
And if you ever cross the line, best believe you get waxed

And a bitch in the rental wit a trunk full of white

Got a phone full of missed calls, beeper full of codes
One eight behind a number mean they want a half of a whole one
Fully loaded most bird punk that'll bang ya

I'm full-time switchin lanes, rims spinnin, swirvin
Full-time on the grind in the North servin

This ya boy Yo Gotti
Street Tunes Productions
We gon' ask everybody to stand up on this one
D Boys, this a gangsta party
Bun B, Eightball and this ya boy Yo Gotti

All my hot girls bop for me
Go 'head and drop for me
D Boys rock with me
Come buy the bar with me
Dime pieces smile for me
And all my gangsta niggas wild for me
Throughout the crowd with me

This for them big, thick fine girls, diamond-studded belly ring
Niggas who be flippin' that work, screamin' money ain't no thing
Car clean, mouth full of gold with the princess cut rocks in it
Back pockets hangin' low because I got a Glock in it
Straight out of that Memphis, Tenn Orangemound for y'all niggas don't know
Come flip with a pimp, let me show ya how to nuke that swing like I was Nino
Premro, Fat Boy, Eightball whatever y'all niggas wanna call me
Call me for a hot sixteen I'mma shine in the booth like a brand new bling
But I don't sing I bust them flows that go so tight with the track
Bitches get freaky niggas get crunk and don't know how to act
I got the sack roll something, pop that 'gnac and po' it
Ya fine bitches pop that puss like ya know it

I was movin' 'caine just doin' my thang
Down here in Memphis where we off the chain
Now, turn the top on my sixty-seven class then I'm switchin' lanes
I done served a fiend, sipped the lean, twenty-four inches don't cloud my screen
Roll candy paint, blowin' purple dank, they claim grip grain but I know they ain't
I'm posted in the club, we can get it poppin'
Ya violate my gangsta partner then it's bodies droppin'
I just come to party, get at shorty head
Do my thang, spit some game you know how Gotti play it
I'm like all these hoes gon' get it man
One of these hoes gon' get it man
From the 'Mound to the west to the north to the south
Yo Gotti gon' represent it man
No fitted man just a head band, Polo shirt and some Birdmans
Still thugged out and it ain't no secret
I got my paper out the drug zones
I got my paper out the gutter man
Sellin' bud man with my brother man
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days
You'd see why Gotti still love the game
My wrist, my neck, my ear, my hand, my mouth look like a light show
Yo bitch, my bitch, his bitch, her bitch just hit the flo' and get it low

This for all my street niggas and bitches
From M Town to H-Town
Free Pimp C, shit

Here we come, we keepin' it trill
Ain't no need to ask if you see
Ain't nobody gon' keep it triller than me
Myself and I that's Bun B
I'm a G, I'm a boss, I grip grain and I sip lean
I'm ball all out with the biggest G's and spit and throw the sixteen
When it come down to the south you know that I'm holdin' the key
I be in the Caddy rollin' on women damn near older than me
Them screens six inches or better, the stitches in the leather
If the trunk is popped it'll show in neon get it together
Cuz when I pull up at the valet man
Eyes is wide and them jaws is droppin'
Steppin' out the freshest clothes, brightest ice man the show is stoppin'
People start oohin' me eyein' soon as they see us
Women wanna be with us and fellas they wanna be us
We the G's and don't try to fight it, got dro and we fixin' light it
Laid back and that thang up on us we startin' to get excited
I'm ballin' with Yo Gotti and Eightball two of Memphis tightest
Cuz we havin' a gangsta party man everyone's invited

She was light, bright, damn near white
Wit dem, chinese eyes, and big girl thighs
And it was, so many rumors, and so many lies
About my, so many girls, and so many wives
That it, broke up my home, she left me alone
And i was tryin to explain to her on the phone
But im like what was the use of tellin the truth
Plus i was, trained at a youth to do what i do
So i just tell her some lies to make her feel good
Like, one day im movin you out the hood
It went from kisses and hugs to pushes and shoves but dat was all a part of F**kin wit thugs
{chorus 2x}
If you was down you would steel fo' a nigga, stay by my side even kill fo' a nigga, if you f**k wit a nigga fo'real then it ain't nothing to keepin it trill
{Verse 2}
She just, wanted to smile and wanted a child
But i was ruining her dreams by livin too wild
She said i need to calm down and act like a man
And my response was like what the f**k is u sayin
Cuz i was, so caught up into movin it white, and i was gone 24/7 a night
And i didn't give a f**k if i was wrong or was right
Cuz i was a d-boi livin a d-boi's life
And she was a school girl slash d-boi's wife
And it was in wit the wrong and out wit the right
Cuz she was trafficin' and manufacturin drugs
But that was all apart of f**kin wit thugs
{chorus 2x}
If you was down you would steel fo' a nigga, stay by my side even kill fo' a nigga, if you f**k wit a nigga fo'real then it ain't nothing to keepin it trill
{Verse 3}
We was tighter then fam, cooler than friends
We thought it would last 4ever and never would end
And we'd get mad at each other and try to pretend
Like we was callin it quits, wasn't speakin again
We went our seperate ways fo a couple of days
You know the seperate phase fo' hell of some days
But uh i regret ever doin her friend
But it was the need of the moment and u know us men
We just think wit out actin my man was back trackin but still i say what i mean and mean what i say cuz im real so play ya position and show us some love cuz that was all a part of f**kin wit thugs

Como es posible que me llamen extranjero

Económicamente ya para muchos no hay otra solución que abandonar
Su patria tal vez para siempre el mexicano da dos pasos
Y aquí esta hoy lo echan y al siguiente día esta de regreso
Eso es un lujo que no me puedo dar sin
Que me maten o que me lleven preso
Es lindo México pero cuanto sufrí
Atravesarlo sin papeles es muy duro
Los cinco mil kilómetros que recorrí
Puedo decir que los recuerdo uno por uno
Por Arizona me dijeron cruzaras
Y que me aviento por el medio del desierto
Por suerte un mexicano a la que llamaba Juan
Me dio la mano que si no estuviera muerto
Ahora que por fin logre la legalización
Lo que sufrí lo he recuperado con creces

Y darte mi cariño
Si me vas a dejar
Pues que sea para siempre
No me gusta agarrar
Amores que se van
Y luego se arrepienten
Si me vas a dejar
Nada mas no te rajes
Por que oí que decías
Que te quieres marchar
Y eso no me gusta
Que alguien me amenace
Cuando digas adiós
Yo no te detendré
En cosas del amor
No le he rogado a nadie
Recuérdalo muy bien
Que yo te se querer
Pero si tu te marchas
También sabré olvidarte
Si me vas a dejar
Pues que sea para siempre
No me gusta agarrar

Y luego se arrepienten

Nada mas no te rajes

Para la reina del sur, traficante muy famosa
Nacida allá en Sinaloa, la tía Teresa Mendoza
""El Güero"" le dijo a Tere, ""Te dejo mi celular
Cuando lo escuches, prietita, no trates de contestar
Es porque ya me torcieron y tú tendrás que escapar""
""El Güero"" Dávila era piloto muy arriesgado
Al cartel de Cuidad Juárez les hizo muchos mandados
En una Avioneta Cessna, en la sierra lo mataron
Dijo Epifanio Vargas, ""Teresa, vas a escapar
Tengo un amigo en España, allá te puede esperar
Me debe muchos favores y te tendrá que ayudar""
Cuando llegó a Melilla, luego le cambió la suerte
Con Don Santiago Fisterra, juntaron bastante gente
Comprando y vendiendo droga para los dos continentes
Manolo Céspedes dijo: ""Teresa es muy arriesgada
Le vende la droga a Francia, África, y también a Italia
Hasta los rusos le compran, es una tía muy pesada""
Supo aprender el acento que se usa por todo España
Demostró su jerarquía como la más noble dama
A muchos los sorprendió, Teresa, la mexicana
A veces de piel vestía de su tierra, se acordaba
Con bota de cocodrilo y avestruz la chamarra
Usaba cinto piteado, tequila cuando brindaba
Era la reina del sur, allá en su tierra natal
Teresa la mexicana, del otro lado del mar
Una mujer muy valiente, que no la van a olvidar
Un día desapareció, Teresa, la mexicana
Dicen que que está en la prisión, otros que vive en Italia
En California o Miami de la unión americanaEmbed",9369.0,La Reina del Sur,

Su promedio era muy bajo, grosero con su mamá
Cerraba el cuarto con llave, dizque ""su privacidad""
Pero de armas en mi casa, él ocultaba un arsenal
El jueves de esa semana le conocí un par de amigos
Portaban otro semblante, no era gente de su tipo
Cosas raras me callaba con tal yo de ser su amigo
Y por no verlo enojado le cumplía cualquier capricho

Y ese día fue el final
Que el hijo más pequeño a la escuela iría a estudiar
Los carteles de la mafia cuentas iban a justar
Y con una bala perdida, me destrozaban mi hogar
La sorpresa es fatal
Que el hijo, el de dieciocho, muy involucrado está
Con la muerte, con las drogas, participa en la crueldad
Y en la muerte de su hermano fue el autor intelectual

Soy otro en la suma nada más
Que es victima del diario en la corrupta sociedad
Todo sabemos de alguien que hace daño a los demás
Y sus errores yo solía solapar
Y hoy vengo a delatar
Al matón que anda en la calle, forma parte de mi hogar
Uno menos que ande suelto al mundo le servirá

En los Estados Unidos
Pues mis padres me trajeron
Desde cuando yo era un niño
Ya me naturalizaron
Y no digo que soy gringo
Sin embargo agradezco
Que me cobijó esta patria
Donde mis padres me dieron
Mis estudios y una casa
Me conduelo del mojado
Que ha caído en la desgracia

En la unión Americana
Yo quisiera un presidente
Pero con la sangre azteca
Para que ayude a su gente
Ese gallo del mojado
Cantaría muy diferente
No está lejos de pasar
Pues con tantos ciudadano
Que le corre por las venas
Sangre de los Mexicanos
La sorpresa nos dará
Como el afroamericano
Muchos buscan el país
De la oportunidad
Donde quiera la tenemos
Si queremos trabajar
Nunca vas a comer tuna
Si no la sabes pelar

Yo quisiera un presidente

Y que lo hizo su amigo, por su confianza ganar
Con un millón de los verdes no lo pudieron comprar
Al delegado en Tijuana, al valiente federal
Hay gente que su trabajo lo quiere y sabe cuidar

No quieren que exista droga, pues dicen que es un peligro

Y sin dudarlo a todos metieron en el interior de un vagón
El tren cruzó al otro lado casi siete horas después
Fue cuando el aire empezó a terminarse y ya nada pudieron hacer
Nadie escuchó aquellos gritos de auxilio y la puerta no quiso ceder

Y se fue, y se fue a cruzar el cielo con sus ansias de crecer

Y en dos y trecientos metros levanto las avionetas
De diferentes calibres manejo las metralletas

Él sabe que en esta chamba no es bueno volar dormido

Me gusta que me platiquen, pero no todo les creo

Eres la consentida
La dueña de mi vida
Porque me has hecho feliz

Era sufrir y sufrir
Como amuleto prendido al pecho
Te llevo cerca del corazón

¿En la cárcel?, ¿pero cómo?

Sentí que el llanto me empezaba a traicionar
Tras de las rejas me miraba con cariño

Perdí la vida enredado en los negocios
Fueron mis socios, la locura y la ambición
No tuve tiempo de jugar con el un poco
Ni cultivarle con amor su corazón
Me lo educaron por las calles poco a poco
Me lo entregaron con diploma de prisión
Cómo quisiera regresarlo quince años
Y que su celda le pudiera derrumbar
Como me duele ver mi sangre prisionera
Como una fiera caminar por el penal
Siento en el alma los reproches de su madre
Él no es culpable y yo soy el criminal
¿Dónde ha quedado mi niño?
Cuando me pidió cariño no le abrí mi corazón
Nunca lo lleve a la escuela
Poco lo arrulle en mis brazos
Tampoco le di su abrazo el día de su graduación
Hice mi Dios del dinero
Y al hijo que tanto quiero lo hice fiera de prisión
¿De qué me sirvió el dinero?
Si terminé limosnero, mendigando por mi hijo compasión

Y tambien en sur chigago
Ya se sabia del soplon

Pudo escapar de milagro

Que tambien murio en la quema
Dijo que estaba escondido
En la ciudad de las vegas
Que ya se iba para europa

Este fue un fin de semana
Pero lo encontraron muerto

Una mujer muy bonita
Que fue novia de quintana

Cuando se apuesta la vida
Lauro no quiso entenderlo
Y traiciono a la famila
Le costo mucho dinero
Y al final hasta la vida

Era de ojitos borrados
Segun el retrato hablado
Por la version de un empleado
Ella escapo de la ley
Y nunca la han encontrado

Y aquí esta hoy lo echan y al siguiente día esta de regreso

Que me maten o que me lleven preso
Es lindo México pero cuanto sufrí
Atravesarlo sin papeles es muy duro
Los cinco mil kilómetros que recorrí
Puedo decir que los recuerdo uno por uno
Por Arizona me dijeron cruzaras
Y que me aviento por el medio del desierto
Por suerte un mexicano a la que llamaba Juan
Me dio la mano que si no estuviera muerto
Ahora que por fin logre la legalización
Lo que sufrí lo he recuperado con creces

Que me dio un gran dolor
¿Que le pasa mi amigo?, se le nota en la voz
Que la quiso en el alma con amor verdadero
Es verdad compañero, yo la quise a morir
La adoré como a nadie, pero no hubo dinero
Y se fue tras el brillo que produce el metal
Y señor locutor, eso me hace llorar
¿Bueno, bueno?
¿Bueno?, dígame
Señor locutor, si me hace el favor
Dígale a ese señor que no mienta, por dios
Dígale, que si ya se olvidó que a esa buena mujer
Él fue quién le falló
No me cuelgue mi amigo, entiendo que es usted
El tercero en discordia de esta historia de amor
No es así, no señor, siento que a esa mujer
Yo la llevo en el alma con el más limpio amor
Usted me la robó
No diga tonterías
Ella siempre lo amo
No cuelguen, por favor
¡Qué historia de amor!
¡Qué historia!
Usted me la robó
No mi amigo, discúlpeme, haga usted memoria
Oigan, escúchenme los dos, el amor es así
A unos hace gozar y a otros hace sufrir
Usted, el primero que hablo, si la hizo llorar
Hoy pídale perdón
Si me estás escuchando, donde quiera que estés
Por favor, te suplico que perdones mi error
Ya es demasiado tarde, esa santa mujer
Se murió de tristeza el día que nací yo
¿Es que tú eres tu mi hijo?
Discúlpeme señor
Padre no es que engendra
Un padre es todo amor
¡Perdóname, hijo mio!
No puedo perdonar
Pero a mi santa madre
Déjela descansarEmbed",12720.0,Señor Locutor,

Decia la gente llorando
Cerca de cien mil personas
Al panteon lo acompañaron
Fueron tres mil efectivos
Los que lograron cazarle
Dieciseis meses huyendo
Era imposible escaparse
¿que puede deber el hombre
Que con la vida no pague?
Las gentes buenas del mundo
Su familia rechazaron
Es un epilogo triste
Perdon si los he ofendido
Porque el hombre siempre busca
Lo que jamas ha perdido
La tierra no hace reproches
Dijo su madre en un rezo
Porque del polvo saliste
Tendra que cubrir tu cuerpo
Que Dios perdone tus actos
Despues rezo un Padre NuestroEmbed",,Muerte anunciada,

Pues dicen que Doña Rita, mama de Lupita, es prima de Adrián
Que es un familiar lejano, de Maximiliano el tío de Julián
Y dicen que el es sobrino, de un tal Maximino cuñado de Abraham
Que viene siendo pariente, de Polo y Valente, hijo de Fabián
Que es hermano de Fernando, compadre de Armando
Y también de Germán
Nieto de Rosa la abuela de Doña Marcela la madre de Juan
(Oh my Good, pero que líos)
Ay que relajo Dios mío, pues mira que lío, se vino a formar
Resulta que hoy Doña Rita, no deja a Lupita, casarse con Juan
Ya saben como es la gente, el dime y direte, se ha extendido ya
Fíjate compadre Chente, que lo de parientes va creciendo más
Además, Don Primitivo, el padre adoptivo de Lupe veras
Se dice primo segundo del señor Raymundo cuñado de Blas
El sobrinito de Chela, la tía de Carmela, y dicen por ahí
Que es bisnieta de Don Lolo, que aunque vive solo
Según Don Tomas
Con Doña María, asegura tuvo una aventura, y nació Nicolás
El fue el que crío a Don Ernesto, el que por supuesto
Es el padre de Juan

Y se fue, y se fue a cruzar el cielo con sus ansias de crecer
Se fue, sin saber que ya su esposa un hijo suyo iba a tener

De noche mi timón, navega sin amarra
El antro de lo peor me atapa entre sus garras
Si hay vino si hay mujeres si hay guitarras
Yo todo lo que tengo lo doy por las damas
Y nunca me entretengo a ver si me aman
Les doy mi corazón, tan solo una semana

Ahí aprendí a hacer las cuentas nomás contando costales
Me gusta burlar las redes que tienden los federales
Muy pegadito a la sierra tengo un rancho ganadero
Ganado sin garrapatas que llevo pa'l extranjero

Y en dos y trecientos metros levanto las avionetas
De diferentes calibres manejo las metralletas

Maestro en la pista chica, además muy precavido
Él sabe que en esta chamba no es bueno volar dormido

Por ahí andan platicando que un día me van a matar
No me asustan las culebras, yo sé perder y ganar
Ahí traigo un cuerno de chivo para el que le quiera entrar
Por el negocio que tengo donde quiera me paseo
No me gusta que presuman, tampoco me miren feo
Me gusta que me platiquen, pero no todo les creo
Los Pinos me dan la sombra, mi rancho, pacas de a kilo

Que tenía siete destinos
Y los tenía que cumplir

Mas los besos que le doy, ella bien que los comprende
I wish to tell you in this song how much I love you
I hope my love can make you come back pretty soon
Never forget to return here I'll be waiting, alone and praying
Come back, release me, give me freedom, give me love
Cuando ella vuelva otra vez, escuchará mis canciones
Se las cantaré en inglés, me aprenderé las lecciones
Y si quiere quedar, le compraré una casita
Y ahí le voy a enseñar, ""espanish"" a mi pochita
I wish to tell you in this song how much I love you
I hope my love can make you come back pretty soon
Never forget to return here I'll be waiting, alone and praying
Come back, release me, give me freedom, give me love
Quiero decirte en mi canción que te amo tanto
Espero pronto mi amor te haga regresar
Nunca te olvides que esperando tu regreso
Estaré en preso, regresa pronto, dame amor y libertadEmbed",,El bilingüe,

A Don Antonio Fonseca se le acercaba la hora
(También venían en la lista una hermana y su señora)
Dijo el doctor a su esposa: quiero llevarte a cenar
Estamos recién casados, la vida hay que disfrutar
(No sabían que de esa cena ya no iban a regresar)
Discutió con un mesero que una patrulla llamo
Eso es lo que yo no entiendo, llego una concentración
(Tal vez una coincidencia, tal vez una ejecución)
(Grita su esposa Dorita: no tiren que vienen damas
Aquella voz suplicante se apago con las metrallas
En unos cuantos segundos la iba a seguir su cuñada)
Le dijo el doctor al pollo: debes usar la metralla
No vez que estamos sitiados, hay que morir en la raya
(El pollo no reacciono y lo tumbaron las balas)
Cerca de 300 balas tenia su carro blindado
Pero ninguna pasó, trabajo garantizado
(Pero al salir por su esposa las balas lo acribillaron)
Allá por el mes de Julio le habían matado un hermano
El mato 2 policías, seguro querían vengarlos
(Su cuerno se le trabo y así lograron matarlo)
(Dijeron que eran bandidos por eso lo remataron
Le robaron sus alhajas y dinero americano
El dinero es lo de menos porque van a seguir bastos

Debe de ser castigado""
Al oír la acusación, el juez le dice al penado:
""Ante tal acuse dime, ¿qué alegas en tu defensa antes de ser sentenciado""
Escuche señor juez mis palabras y de ahí juzgue mis actos
Del mucho tiempo que llevo en este penal, no he recibido:
Carta, visita, esperanza ni consuelo alguno
Siempre he deseado dinero para comprar una biblia, pero jamás lo he tenido
Mis compañeros en cambio juegan, pierden y dilapan con sus barajas el poco dinero que de sus familiares reciben
Un día un reo que era conducido gravemente al hospital, me regaló esta baraja
Desde entonces señor mío se posesiono en mi el pensamiento
De hacer de cada carta de la baraja un pasaje de la biblia;
La baraja señor tiene 365 puntos como 365 días tiene el año
Se divide en cuatro colores, como cuatro estaciones tiene el año
El As, el As me recuerda a Dios padre
El dos, las partes en que se dividieron las sagradas escrituras: antiguo y nuevo testamento
El tres, me representa a la santísima trinidad: Dios padre, Dios hijo y Dios espíritu santo
El cuatro, los cuatro evangelios: Mateo, Lucas, Marcos y Juan
El cinco: me recuerda las cinco yagas de cristo en el calvario
El seis, los días que tomó Dios, nuestro señor para crear todo lo que en materia poseemos
El siete, el séptimo día que impuso de descanso después de haber logrado su propósito
El ocho, la circuncisión de Jesucristo al octavo día de vida
El nueve, los nueve meses de embarazo de nuestra Virgen María
El diez, los diez mandamientos
El once, el numero de apóstoles después de la traición y muerte de Judas
El doce, me recuerda a los doce apóstoles y este que está representado por un rey
Me confirma que todas las cosas están gobernadas por un solo rey:
Dios, hermoso y todopoderoso
Eso es todo lo que tengo que decir en mi defensa
Júzguenme, si he faltadoEmbed",,La Baraja Bendita,

No hay amigos sinceros
Se les compra con dinero
Y la mujer amada sin metal te paga mal

Su amor y sus bonanzas
Todo el que ofrece algo siempre espera algo mejor

Traían las llantas del carro repletas de hierba mala
Eran Emilio Varela y Camelia la Texana
Pasaron por San Clemente, los paró la emigración
Les pidió sus documentos, les dijo: ""¿De dónde son?""
Ella era de San Antonio, una hembra de corazón
Una hembra, si quiere a un hombre, por él puede dar la vida
Pero hay que tener cuidado si esa hembra se siente herida
La traición y el contrabando son cosas incompartidas
A Los Angeles llegaron, a Hollywood se pasaron
En un callejón obscuro, las cuatro llantas cambiaron
Ahí entregaron la hierba y ahí también les pagaron
Emilio dice a Camelia: ""Hoy te das por despedida
Con la parte que te toca, tú puedes rehacer tu vida
Yo me voy para San Francisco con la dueña de mi vida""

Eu gosto tanto de você
Mas isso tudo me dá
Frio na barriga demais
Longe de casa e dos meus
Só tem você minha paz
Mas eu não sei confiar

Em ninguém, até eu sei que você me quer bem
Sei que tu quer me ganhar, meu bem
Sei que eu também não sou de ninguém
Tu só me ganha no olhar, no jeito de amar
E tu ainda canta bem
Sei que sempre que eu chamar, 'cê vem
Sei que sempre que еu pedir, tu tem

Pra me dar amor logo toda manhã
Baby mе guarda que eu volto amanhã
Você me guarda que eu também te guardo
E me beija com a boca de hortelã
Escreve mais um som que tu é tão bom
Toda vez é pra mim quero mais um
Eu não sou qualquer uma
Tu não é qualquer um
Eu sou bem melhor sozinha, sabe

Ei, eu sei do caos da vida, eu cuido do nosso perigo

Vem, não demora
Fica comigo a noite toda, perde a hora
No meu ouvido sussurrando com a voz rouca
Dizendo que me quer pra agora a vida toda, pra vida toda

Ayy, posso ficar se pá dez ou quinze min', me entenda, por favor
Tenho casa cheia hoje, amor
Quinta o TVZ já me chamou
Sexta-feira ingresso já acabou
Sábado tem sul, de novo eu vou
Mas domingo chego de manhã
Deito no teu lado pique de concha
Pego forte, fico então na tua coxa
Se tu me der permissão eu posso entrar, baby
Sem deslizar, baby, só não vacilar
Que eu posso me cansar
Que eu deixo de sorrir
Se o beijo bom virar vontade de chorar, porra, nega, ayy
Vem, não demora
Fica comigo a noite toda, perde a hora
No meu ouvido sussurrando com a voz rouca
Dizendo que me quer pra agora a vida toda, pra vida toda
Vem, não demora
Fica comigo a noite toda, perde a hora
No meu ouvido sussurrando com a voz rouca
Dizendo que me quer pra agora a vida toda, pra vida toda

Um beijo como esse não tem (Não tem)
Um abraço como esse não tem (Não tem)
Pegada como essa não tem (Não tem)
Encaixe como esse não tem
Um beijo como esse não tem (Não tem)
Um abraço como esse não tem (Não tem)
Pegada como essa não tem (Não tem)

Sou mais quente que o Saara

Quantas vezes me olhei no espelho
E não me reconheci?
Quantas vezes chorei no chuveiro
Mesmo tendo que sorrir?

Fugi pra algum lugar
Que pudesse sonhar
E ser feliz
Sem julgamentos, opressões
Sem fingimentos
Leva isso daqui

Hoje eu só quero ser eu
Quero ser apenas eu
Tentar, errar, lutar
Ter a chance de me permitir
Só quero ser eu
Hoje eu só quero ser eu
Quero ser apenas eu
Tentar, errar, lutar
Ter a chance de me permitir
Em meio a tempestade, floresci
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Quantas vezes me tranquei pro mundo
Tentando me redescobrir?
Quantas vezes quis um ombro amigo
Sem ninguém pra me ouvir?

Fugi pra algum lugar
Que pudesse sonhar
E ser feliz
Sem julgamentos, opressões
Sem fingimentos
Leva isso daqui

Hoje eu só quero ser eu
Quero ser apenas eu

Back 2 life, back 2 reality
Back 2 life, back 2 reality

Goin' through a dark place dark time, and I couldn't even see the light
Had my back up against the wall, I was feeling like do or die
But what don't kill me make me stronger, I know it's gonna be alright
So we celebrating here tonight, yeah, we celebrating life tonight

The time is now, gotta make it count
So before we die, let's go all out

We gotta live up, up, up, up, up
Champagne in my cup, cup, cup, cup, cup
DJ turn it up, up, up, up, up
Bring me back 2 life, back 2 life
Yea, we gotta live it up, up, up, up, up
You know we don't give a what what what what what
So til my time's up, up, up, up, up
Bring me back to life, back to life
Back to life

All the tears and all of the prayers, every single one of y'all showed me
So the love I'm givin' back to y'all is bigger than the whole country
From England to Japan to Jamaica to right down the M-I-A
We don't stop, we go hard, let's get it in, call it young and free


Okay, them suckas tried to bury me, Jesus had to carry me
Middle finger to the reaper, nigga ain't no scarin' me
Apparently, you dont understand who I am
It's trouble man hundred grand in my pan
Whippin' dropheads, hardtops, fit to sell Maybachs
Maseratis, Ferrari's those money I dont play by
Presidents stop me, imagine if I stay down
Still shining on to make them haters pull they shades out
When tragedy strikes, I struck back
Looking for me to roll over and die, who does that?
Left a nigga for dead, came back to life
I guess this is me ballin' in the afterlife
Let's hit it

She know she ain't right

Weren't you the one who said
That I'd be lost without you
(No, no, no, no)

This one without you, baby

And now I see your face drop
I told you not to leave me alone
And now that I got my own
I see your face drop
I told you not to count me out, hey
Cause you always try to fill me with doubt
Sayin' that I look better if I was thinner
Don't you know you shoulda love me for my inner
When I left you, yo, I came out a winner
Did all I can, I understand
That every girl do for their man

Ooh girl, you got me thinking 'bout the island breeze

Girl, you're royalty but what you doin' here without your king?

If it was up to me you'd be wearin' my diamond ring
Ooh
Come home with me, take you overseas
'Cause you move like that's where you belong
Picture us by the water, our bodies gettin' hotter
We'll be jammin' to the early morn

J.R., Sean Kingston

You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

See, it started at the park
Used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
'Cause we both thought
That love last forever (Last forever)
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (Last together)
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

It was back in '99
Watchin' movies all the time
Oh, when I went away for doin' my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (See each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down south
Oh I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slighted
And I don't know
How to make it better (Make it better)
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh, I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)
You're way too beautiful, girl

And I just wanna tell you I love you

Only 15 put under pressure
First month 27th day
They took away my mother
I was left to be raised by my brother
Tought to be a hustla
Mommy gone gotta stick together
Stay strong through the stormy weather
Became a top seller, look how we stackin this chedder
When you jump mommy life would be better
Just like Rihanna you can stand under my umbrella

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our chedder
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Feelin kinda blue
Cause it's lookin you doin 10 to 20
Ridin bein broke ain't funny
It's all bein hungry
But ima keep hustlin for my mommy
Until I get rich like puffy
Never had a blamby
You said I can be all I can be
Some day Ima buy you miami
So when I win my Grammy
You commin cause I do this for my family

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our chedder

I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you

17 now my mommys gone
Can't wait till she come back home
Missin her face like dust till dawn,while she went away
Never think it be this long
I feel like cryin while I'm writin this song
Can't wait till that day come on
When she leave the place

Hey whats up mom,how you doin?
Its been about 2 years since I saw your face
I miss you like crazy
Know the money orders the pre paid costs
Bein on my own
No Knee Kurt Canino
But I love you though
This for you

You know how to make me better

Hey Yo J.R
I meet A lot of Beautiful girls in my life man
But this situation is kinda wierd
I like her sister

I was just walking out school
I saw this girl gettin off the train
We exchanged numbas and went on a couple dates
At first everything was cool
Until I meet her sista laren
Got introduced to each other and then everything changed

I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit
But my homies said to stay away
But im 17 what you expect me to do
I guess we'll charge it as a part of the game

If I'm wrong oh I dont want to be right
I kissed your sister last night
It ain't my fault
I guess your sister's my type
If I'm wrong oh I dont want to be right
I kissed your sister last night
It ain't my fault
I guess your sister's my type

Now I'm on the telephone talking
With laren but her sisters on the other line
But I can't help myself 'cuz Lorraine too fine
And I know this may be wrong but it feels so right
Her sister is nice but Lorraine is more like sugar and spice

I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit
But my homies said to stay away
But im 17 what you expect me to do
I guess we'll charge it as a part of the game

If I'm wrong oh I dont want to be right
I kissed your sister last night
It ain't my fault
I guess your sister's my type
If I'm wrong oh I dont want to be right
I kissed your sister last night
It ain't my fault
I guess your sister's my type
Sorry that it had to go like this way
But you know your sisters got what I need
Cuz I got to be with Lorraine
And I'm over you
Sorry that it had to go like this way
But you know your sisters got what I need
Cuz I got to be with Lorraine
And I'm over you (Over you)

I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit
But my homies said to stay away
But im 17 what you expect me to do

My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

Check it! I'm the Bastard Of The Party, s*** start off off coke and bacardi
Bandanas tied around the dubs on the Ferarri
I'm the bloods to what Pac was to thugs
What Snoop is to crips I'm the California king
Let it be known, I reign Supreme like Kenneth McGriff
Reincarnated put me in Queens and give me a strip
A couple red tops while the feds watchin
Infiltrate get a head shot Compton is the city of God
My block originators I said blood one on a Dr. Dre track
Now the world is affiliated
Some authentic some n****s Milli Vanilli bangers
Some get smoked others smoke chronic out of philly papers
Game time is really Jacob watches got them silly faces
Add red rubies to the dial they 'gon really hate us
I inherited gang bangin from my mother
And what I didn't get from her I picked up watchin colors
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Jamaica have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My jewels have colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My people die over colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

I'm from a world of different colors different faces
Different slang different races different gangs different places
Air Ones different laces
Different culture different livin different thugs different ages
The sky's blue the money's green the weed is purple
The ice is white you try me I'm a have to hurt you
Kingston boy I rep like no other
Black, yellow and green I bleed the Jamaican colors
The grill is cold the wheels is gold the chrome is silver
Nickel plated if it's blazin than the chrome will kill ya
Certain dudes get one in the head
Certain places you wear certain colors you dead
Fi yuh gang bang yuh diss mi yuh a dead man
Cau gunshot a be like drum pan weh mi come from
And it's the same old story
We don't give a damn about your guts and glory
